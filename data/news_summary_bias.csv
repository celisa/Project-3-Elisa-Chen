Deepali Aggarwal,31 Jul 2017,venezuela heading for dictatorship after 'sham' election: us,www.theguardian.com,"calling venezuela's recent constituent assembly election a ""sham"", us ambassador nikki haley said that venezuela is heading towards a dictatorship. haley also threatened strong and swift action against the ""architects of authoritarianism"" in venezuela. she added that the us stands by venezuelans and their constitutional representatives to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy.","the united states has vowed to take strong and swift action against the ?architects of authoritarianism? in venezuela after protesters and security forces fought deadly street battles during voting for president nicolás maduro?s controversial constitutional assembly.?the united states stands by the people of venezuela, and their constitutional representatives, in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy,? the us state department said in a statement. ?we will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in venezuela, including those who participate in the national constituent assembly as a result of today?s flawed election,? it said. many voters decided against taking part in an election the opposition said would turn the country into a full-fledged dictatorship.as many as 14 people died in the protests, according to opposition leader henrique capriles, and the prosecutor?s office confirmed at least six people were killed by gunfire, including one national guardsman. seven policemen were wounded in an explosion in the opposition stronghold neighbourhood of altamira.however, the leader of the ruling socialist party, jorge rodriguez, said there was ?not one death related to the voting process today?, underscoring the contrasting versions of the day presented by the two clashing sides.nikki haley, the us ambassador to the united nations, tweeted: ?maduro?s sham election is another step toward dictatorship.?maduro?s sham election is another step toward dictatorship. we won't accept an illegit govt. the venezuelan ppl & democracy will prevail.an official report of a ?positive? election process by the national electoral council contrasted with continued reports of clashes and widespread abstention as people either heeded opposition calls for a boycott or feared getting caught up in street clashes.the council extended voting for one hour, claiming many who had wanted to casttheir vote earlier had been unable to do so.maduro was among the first to vote shortly after polls opened at 6am. ?the first vote for peace,? he said afterwards. but throughout the day, turnout at polling stations was low for the election of 545 members of an assembly that would be tasked with rewriting the constitution and would have sweeping powers to reform or dissolve other state institutions, including the opposition controlled parliament.in the working-class district of petare, where many residents said they had been threatened with losing government subsidies or jobs if they did not vote, few people turned out to vote. but at the poliedro sporting arena, where caracas residents who were unable to reach their designated polling centre were permitted to cast their votes, voters described huge crowds standing in line. for maria alejandra avila, a lawyer , the election was a manifestation of ?the self?determination of a free and sovereign people?.the constituent assembly has been heavily criticised by foreign government including from the united states, the uk and neighbouring colombia. on sunday, peru and argentina said they would not recognise the outcome of the vote.security forces blocked protesters from gathering for a planned mass demonstration using teargas to disperse the crowd, witnesses said. a small group of protesters blocked access to some of the voting places.?the oppressive forces didn?t allow us to even get to the meeting point,? said protester emilia lópez, 23. ?it is frustrating that they try to keep us quiet with bombs.?opposition leader maría corina machado told reporters that this moment was the beginning of a new phase for venezuela.the defence minister, vladimir padrino lópez, told reporters that a 130,000-strong security force was ?actively containing? flareups across the country, adding that as many as 100 voting machines had been destroyed.security cordons were set up around each voting centre and reporters were not allowed beyond that point to witness people casting their votes. after more than four months of protests sparked by the pro-government supreme court decision to strip the opposition-controlled parliament of its legislative powers, the government banned protests ahead of sunday?s vote. maduro has said the assembly will help bring peace to the politically split country, but the opposition, and increasingly the international community, have warned that it will only serve for maduro and the ruling socialist party to tighten their grip on power. the new assembly will be convened within 72 hours of the election and will function with virtually unlimited powers. maduro and his closest allies have vowed to use the assembly to jail key opposition leaders, remove the country?s outspoken chief prosecutor from her post and strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity.polls show that maduro, successor to hugo chávez, who set the country on a socialist path, has only about a 20-point approval rating and that 70% of venezuelans do not want the constitution of 1999 rewritten.maduro said on saturday that the assembly would act as a ?superpower (...) above and beyond every other?. the assembly, he said in a television address ahead of the vote, will be empowered to strip opposition legislators of immunity from prosecution. ?the right wing already has its prison cell waiting,? the president said.maduro accused right-wing governments of trying to sabotage ?21st century socialism?.the us imposed targeted sanctions against 13 current and former officials close to the government last week and has primed further measures if the assembly vote was held, which may affect venezuela?s oil industry, one of the few economic lifelines left in the country. under maduro, elected after chávez?s death from cancer in 2013, the once buoyant oil-based economy plunged into crisis crippling the social programs chavez had set up for venezuela?s poor majority. price controls brought widespread food and medicine shortages and spiralling inflation, as well as unbridled violence, driving millions of venezuelans to leave the country.additional reporting by ana sofia romero in caracas   ",NEUTRAL,0.6755974292755127

Dishant Sharma,31 Jul 2017,mercedes' lewis hamilton gave up podium finish for teammate,www.theguardian.com,"british f1 driver lewis hamilton gave up on a third place finish at the hungarian grand prix to let his teammate valtteri bottas finish third instead. hamilton, who was fourth placed, asked mercedes to tell bottas to let him through to chase down the leading ferraris, agreeing to give the third place back if he fails to overtake them.","the hungarian grand prix could yet stand as one of the defining moments of the 2017 formula one season.under the unyielding sun of a budapest summer the two title protagonists, who have been equally unforgiving on track in a battle that has swayed gloriously between them, finally showed their hands as to how that fight would proceed in the second half of the season.sebastian vettel won what was hardly a classic race but lewis hamilton, in standing by his team-mate, admitted he might have dropped points that could ultimately cost him the world championship.vettel won at the hungaroring with an impressive drive from pole position. that he did so while nursing a damaged steering wheel made it all the more of an achievement but also put the scuderia on the spot.his team-mate kimi raikkonen was quicker on track but they chose not to order vettel to allow him to pass. that the german is their only title contender could not have been clearer.in their wake hamilton was on a charge and in turn faster than his team?mate valtteri bottas. with passing at the hungaroring all but impossible this year, he asked mercedes to tell bottas to let him through to chase down the leading ferraris, agreeing that he would give the place back should he fail to overtake them. bottas let him through and, unable to pass raikkonen and seven seconds up the road from his team-mate, hamilton duly gave back the place on the final lap. raikkonen held second, with bottas in third and hamilton fourth.the british driver now trails vettel by 14 points in the world championship and ceding the place cost him three. with the title fight likely to go to the wire it might yet prove to have been the sportsmanlike gesture that could deny him a fourth drivers? title this year.?i want to win the championship the right way,? he said. ?i don?t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not but i said at the beginning of the year, i want to win it the right way. i do think today was the right way to do things.?ferrari have a long history of imposing team orders and designating a no1 driver but the mercedes executive director, toto wolff, agreed with hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the scuderia went racing.?we have seen the backlash from decisions that were ruthless and cold blooded and the effect that it had on the brand,? he said. ?you could say: ?screw it, it still won them the championship, who cares? they are in the history books.? but i do not think that is the right spin and if the purpose of us being here is to do the right things and win in the right way ? sometimes doing it the right way and standing by your values is tough and it was today, believe me.?giving the place back was no easy feat. bottas was only just in front of the red bull of max verstappen and there was a real danger the manoeuvre could have cost hamilton two places. the team had debated whether it should be done but were clear hamilton was not instructed to do so and that he was merely sticking to his word.?it was very sportsmanlike behaviour,? said wolff, who also acknowledged that it could cost hamilton the title. ?these values won us six championships and it will make us win more championships in years to come. it cost us three points and could cost us the championship and we are perfectly conscious of that. but in terms of how the drivers and this team operates, we stick to what we say and if the consequences are as much as losing the championship, then we will take it.?there was little doubt that vettel deserved the 25 points, both he and raikkonen having a pace advantage in the early stage over mercedes. but he revealed he was wrestling with his damaged car from the off. ?i felt there was something not right on the grid and for the formation lap the steering wheel was not straight,? he said.?then it got worse and towards the end of the stint it was more difficult. we spoke on the radio about it and i was told to avoid the kerbs but on this track you use them on every corner, so you lose speed. it was good that it is tricky to overtake here. it felt like a very long race.?ferrari have not won the constructors? championship since 2008 and have not taken the drivers? title since raikkonen claimed it in 2007. their step forward to go head-to head with mercedes this season gives them a real opportunity to end the drought.raikkonen might have been passed by hamilton, which would have cost them constructor points, but they opted to gamble on the british driver being unable to do so. it paid off and they can consider their strategy a success but it indicated that they were willing to risk the team championship in favour of backing vettel for the title.maurizio arrivabene, ferrari?s team principal, praised raikkonen for being a ?true team player? and sergio marchionne, the ferrari chief executive, admitted the result had come as a relief. ?it was a much?needed win,? he said. ?the great thing is we earned it, this was a tough, tough race and we almost lost it and we got it back.?vettel holds the lead going into the summer break and he has earned it but hamilton can also rest easy knowing that he held an honourable line in hungary. ?the team were in a difficult position but i think today really shows, hopefully, that i am a man of my word,?

world record in the 100 fly, posting a time of 49.86 that was just four-hundredths off the mark set in 2009 at the rubber suit-aided championships in rome.the final relay was merely a coronation, the americans romping to gold in 3 minutes, 19.60 seconds ? eclipsing by nearly 3 1/2 seconds the mark they set two years ago at worlds.?man, that was a lot of fun,? dressel said.he even managed to overshadow katie ledecky, who won her fifth gold medal of the meet by cruising to victory in the 800 free. yet budapest will be remembered as bit of a disappointment for the star of the 2016 summer games, who settled for silver in the 200 free and didn?t come close to breaking any of her personal bests.ledecky won in 8:12.68, which was nearly eight seconds off her world record at rio de janeiro.?i?ve never walked away from a season completely satisfied, even last year,? she said. ?i can really take what i?ve learned and use it moving forward. it gets me really excited. if that was my bad year for the next four years, then the next couple years are going to be pretty exciting.?sweden?s sarah sjostrom was another standout, bouncing back from a disappointing loss the previous night to win gold in the 50 fly and set a world record in the semifinals of 50 free. her time of 23.67 broke the mark of 23.73, set in 2009 by britta steffen.in the women?s 200 backstroke, emily seebohm of australia shrugged off the roaring hungarian crowd to take gold over home-country favorite katinka hosszu.sjostrom set her second world record of the meet, having already established a new standard in the 100 free while swimming the leadoff leg of the 4x100 free relay.but even the swedish star took note of dressel?s performance.?i don?t even know if he went to the olympics last year,? she said. ?he took a really big step this year as we can see. it?s really impressive, really cool to see.?indeed, dressel has emerged as the breakout performer of these championships, with a bit of help from the relatively new mixed relays. two of his golds came in events that feature men and women on the same team, races phelps never competed in at worlds.?it?s crazy,? dressel said. ?but i had mixed relays helping me out, so it?s a bit different.?yet no less impressive.dressel led off the mixed free relay with a blistering time of 47.22 for the first 100 ? even more remarkable given what he?d already been through ?

Dishant Sharma,30 Jul 2017,completing antibiotics course not necessary: study,www.theguardian.com,"a new study has found the rule that patients must complete the course of their prescribed antibiotics is false instead they should stop taking the drugs when they feel better. the study disproves traditional practice of completing courses, which claims that taking too few tablets allows the disease-causing bacteria to mutate and become resistant to the drug.","telling patients to stop taking antibiotics when they feel better may be preferable to instructing them to finish the course, according to a group of experts who argue that the rule long embedded in the minds of doctors and the public is wrong and should be overturned.patients have traditionally been told that they must complete courses of antibiotics, the theory being that taking too few tablets will allow the bacteria causing their disease to mutate and become resistant to the drug.but martin llewelyn, a professor in infectious diseases at brighton and sussex medical school, and colleagues claim that this is not the case. in an analysis in the british medical journal, the experts say ?the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance?.there are some diseases where the bug can become resistant if the drugs are not taken for long enough. the most obvious example is tuberculosis, they say. but most of the bacteria that cause people to become ill are found on everybody?s hands in the community, causing no harm, such as e coli and staphylococcus aureus. people fall ill only when the bug gets into the bloodstream or the gut. the longer such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely it is that resistance will develop.the experts say there has been too little research into the ideal length of a course of antibiotics, which also varies from one individual to the next, depending in part on what antibiotics they have taken in the past.in hospital, patients can be tested to work out when to stop the drugs. ?outside hospital, where repeated testing may not be feasible, patients might be best advised to stop treatment when they feel better,? they say. that, they add, is in direct contravention of world health organisation advice.other experts in infectious diseases backed the group. ?i have always thought it to be illogical to say that stopping antibiotic treatment early promotes the emergence of drug-resistant organisms,? said peter openshaw, president of the british society for immunology. ?this brief but authoritative review supports the idea that antibiotics may be used more sparingly, pointing out that the evidence for a long duration of therapy is, at best, tenuous. far from being irresponsible, shortening the duration of a course of antibiotics might make antibiotic resistance less likely.?alison holmes, a professor of infectious diseases at imperial college london, said a great british authority, prof harold lambert, had made the same point in a lancet article entitled ?don?t keep taking the tablets? as early as 1999. ?it remains astonishing that apart from some specific infections and conditions, we still do not know more about the optimum duration of courses or indeed doses in many conditions, yet this dogma has been pervasive and persistent.?jodi lindsay, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at st george?s, university of london, said it was sensible advice. ?the evidence for ?completing the course? is poor, and the length of the course of antibiotics has been estimated based on a fear of under-treating rather than any studies,? she said. ?the evidence for shorter courses of antibiotics being equal to longer courses, in terms of cure or outcome, is generally good, although more studies would help and there are a few exceptions when longer courses are better ? for example, tb.?but the royal college of gps expressed concerns. ?recommended courses of antibiotics are not random,? said its chair, prof helen stokes-lampard. ?they are tailored to individual conditions and in many cases, courses are quite short ? for urinary tract infections, for example, three days is often enough to cure the infection. ?we are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication midway through a course once they ?feel better?, because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. it?s important that patients have clear messages and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known. changing this will simply confuse people.?england?s chief medical officer, prof dame sally davies, said: ?the message to the public remains the same: people should always follow the advice of healthcare professionals. to update policies, we need further research to inform them.?[the national institute for health and care excellence] is currently developing guidance for managing common infections, which will look at all available evidence on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.?the department of health will continue to review the evidence on prescribing and drug-resistant infections, as we aim to continue the great progress we have made at home and abroad on this issue.?",SUBJECTIVE,0.5934568643569946

Vani Vivek,29 Jun 2017,the guardian admits whatsapp security flaw report was wrong,www.theguardian.com,"british publication the guardian has admitted its january 2017 report on a loophole in whatsapp's security system was incorrect. the report had claimed that the backdoor lets the facebook-owned chat app intercept and read users' encrypted messages. the newspaper has said that ""misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings"" happened at several stages of the article's reporting process.","the guardian was wrong to report in january that the popular messaging service whatsapp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech.but it was right to bring to wide public notice an aspect of whatsapp that had the potential to make some messages vulnerable to being read by an unintended recipient.the guardian did not test with an appropriate range of experts a claim that had implications for the more than one billion people who use the facebook-owned whatsapp.in a detailed review i found that misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings happened at several stages of the reporting and editing process. cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case.the guardian ought to have responded more effectively to the strong criticism the article generated from well-credentialled experts in the arcane field of developing and adapting end-to-end encryption for a large-scale messaging service.the original article ? now amended and associated with the conclusions of this review ? led to follow-up coverage, some of which sustained the wrong impression given at the outset. the most serious inaccuracy was a claim that whatsapp had a ?backdoor?, an intentional, secret way for third parties to read supposedly private messages. this claim was withdrawn within eight hours of initial publication online, but withdrawn incompletely. the story retained material predicated on the existence of a backdoor, including strongly expressed concerns about threats to freedom, betrayal of trust and benefits for governments which surveil. in effect, having dialled back the cause for alarm, the guardian failed to dial back expressions of alarm.this made a relatively small, expert, vocal and persistent audience very angry. guardian editors did not react to an open letter co-signed by 72 experts in a way commensurate with the combined stature of the critics and the huge number of people potentially affected by the story. the essence of the open letter and a hyperlink to it were added to the article, but wider consultation and a fundamental reconsideration of the story were needed.the aspect of whatsapp at the heart of this matter, put very simply, is as follows. when a user of whatsapp is offline, any messages at that time in transit to him or her are held in facebook?s servers. (if unclaimed after 30 days they are deleted, facebook advised.) if, while offline, the recipient registers a new device, any messages waiting for the person on facebook?s servers are no longer deliverable because they are encrypted for the person?s old device. to prevent those messages from being lost, when the intended recipient comes back online, any in-transit messages are re-encrypted with the new device?s key and resent automatically. if senders have turned on a notification setting in whatsapp on their phone, they are told that the key has changed, but not otherwise.critics said that the guardian article overstated the risk of what is known in the jargon as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party could exploit the combination of offline phone, messages in transit and changed key to intercept private communications.the intensity of the external criticism seems to have stemmed partly from frustration that the article was in the guardian, with its deserved reputation for using and reporting on technology in ways that help bridge the gap between non-experts and specialists.some were concerned that an overstated claim in the guardian about risk to the security of whatsapp would cause non-expert users to become unduly worried and needlessly abandon whatsapp for less secure communication methods.the critics had two different groups of whatsapp users in mind.first, the vast majority of users, for whom whatsapp security is fine and who would probably experience worse communications security if they stopped using it.second, a much smaller group, activists in authoritarian regimes, whose threat model means they need high security and for whom the popularity of whatsapp means they can ?blend into the crowd?. this group could be at serious risk if they abandoned whatsapp for something less secure, or perhaps even for a service more secure but used by relatively few, because that might attract the authorities? attention.a related concern was that authoritarian governments could exploit the guardian story to move against the use of encrypted messaging.during the review i independently confirmed that a turkish government official had used the article when, in effect, attempting to deter users from whatsapp. it was also confirmed that some activists who had been in the process of switching from a less secure messaging service to whatsapp became confused by the guardian story. on available evidence, i am unable to conclude whether these effects were widespread. but one case is one too many.i am not an expert in this field. for the review i consulted suitably experienced experts other than the 72 who had already declared their view.i found a consensus that in practice, as whatsapp is presently understood, it would be very difficult to use this aspect of whatsapp for systematic targeted surveillance. experts described challenges with timing, targeting and concealment which they said would be formidable even for a major private or public actor with access to facebook servers.experts were unanimous that it is not a backdoor. ?vulnerability? is a contested term, acceptable in this context to some but not all. one called it a ?weakness?, others a ?trade-off?.one expert called whatsapp ?pretty excellent security against broad surveillance and that is valuable?. another said the trade-off was reasonable. a third said: ?this product is safe for the majority of people.?i conveyed to facebook one specialist?s proposal that the relevant notification setting should be default opt-out, not default opt-in, so that although in-transit messages would continue to be resent automatically, at least senders would be informed that it had happened unless they turned the notification setting off. facebook replied: ?yes, whatsapp considered this but decided against it when considering how it might be interpreted by the average user, who may be using a smartphone for the first time. instead we chose to make this option available to those wanting an extra layer of security on their accounts.?experts confirmed that weighing these kinds of considerations about user behaviour is normal when designers are deciding the balance between security and usability in a mass-market service like whatsapp. the experts confirmed the gist of the responses to the core guardian article blogged on the day of its publication by two leading figures in developing whatsapp, moxie marlinspike and brian acton.several independent experts agreed with this part of the open letter?s criticism when it was read to them:?it?s important to recognize the tendency of many security researchers, especially inexperienced ones, to overestimate the practical impact of vulnerabilities they find, and being ignorant how security needs play out in the real world, the massive amount of work on actual user behavior in the face of friction and warnings, and the need for independent verification and context.?i accept the consensus view of the experts and, in consultation with editors, have arranged for the coverage to be amended and for a note to be added drawing attention to the review and linking to this column.i do not agree with critics that the story should be entirely retracted. after all the surrounding controversy, the story?s complete disappearance would be odd. more importantly, there is a clear public interest in the guardian preserving (with appropriate amendments) reporting on this aspect of whatsapp and the inherent trade-off. with so many users, watchfulness, news, analysis and debate about the security of whatsapp are important. communications privacy is a key element of human rights in the digital era, and developments affecting it ought to be reported. also, facebook needs scrutiny, both generally due to its power and specifically in its management of whatsapp.facebook?s plan last year to share within its group of companies whatsapp users? personal information caused controversy and appeared to breach prior commitments. regulators stepped in, including in the uk. at least one court has upheld a regulator?s intervention.as one expert noted, facebook?s servers are a black box. it is not possible for outsiders to verify exactly what happens when messages pass through facebook?s servers on their way to and from whatsapp users. trust is required. given facebook?s record, steady scrutiny is the right stance.we learned from edward snowden?s disclosures that large service providers which handle the communications of millions of people have been compromised in the past. sections of a research paper published in march 2017 provide a more recent review of encryption workarounds.the uk home secretary, amber rudd, has wondered aloud whether service providers should continue to be able lawfully to deny to government authorities access to encrypted messaging. measures affecting the security of encrypted messaging seem likely to be among new anti-terrorism proposals.i found a consistent view among experts that facebook could do more to make non-expert users aware of the trade-off and educate them about how to assess their own threat model.since the guardian article, whatsapp has been better secured by the introduction of optional two-factor verification in february. that process was being tested in november 2016 and had been reported in a specialist blog in july 2016, so the guardian coverage did not prompt the improvement. we will probably never know whether it spurred facebook to accelerate the process.",NEUTRAL,0.5160577297210693

who in six months has now lost a chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, national security adviser, communications director and press secretary ? added on twitter: ?i would like to thank reince priebus for his service and dedication to his country. we accomplished a lot together and i am proud of him!?according to a pooled report, trump sent the tweets shortly after air force one landed back at joint base andrews, maryland, following a trip to long island, new york. priebus and scaramucci were also on the flight.in a statement, the white house press secretary, sarah huckabee sanders, said: ?general john kelly is one of the true stars of the administration. he has helped seal the border and reduced illegal immigration by 70%. he is respected by everyone, especially the people at the department of homeland security.?the entire administration loves him and no one is comparable. he will begin on monday morning and a cabinet meeting will follow his swearing in monday morning.?she added: ?the president thanks reince priebus for his service. they accomplished a lot together. he was loyal in his dedication to the president. the president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country, and he will always be a member of the trump team.?sanders then spoke to reporters outside her office. asked if the decision was priebus?s or trump?s, she replied: ?we all serve at the pleasure of the president. the conversations about this started with the president and reince about two weeks ago, in terms of timing.?she denied that the change had anything do with scaramucci, and said trump and kelly had been ?talking about it for a while?.on friday, priebus said in a statement: ?it has been one of the greatest honours of my life to serve this president and our country. i want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. i will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president?s agenda and policies. i can?t think of a better person than john kelly to succeed me and i wish him god?s blessings and great success.?in an interview with cnn just two hours after his departure was announced, priebus paid homage to trump. ?i am going to honor the president every day,? he said, adding: ?i?m always going to be a trump fan. i?m on team trump.? he refused to respond to scaramucci?s comments, saying: ?i?m not going to get into the mud.?while priebus insisted he had resigned, there were strong hints that there was more under the surface. he said on cnn that the president had wanted to ?hit the reset button? and ?intuitively determined that it was time to do something differently?.on friday, house speaker paul ryan, a close priebus ally who has had a tense relationship with trump, said: ?reince priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country. here is a guy from kenosha, wisconsin, who revitalized the republican national committee and became white house chief of staff. he has served the president and the american people capably and passionately. he has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. i could not be more proud to call reince a dear friend.?he added: ?i congratulate secretary kelly on his appointment, and look forward to working with him to advance our agenda.?priebus was one of the least powerful chiefs of staff in recent history, and his future had long been a matter of speculation. in a highly unorthodox move, trump decided that priebus and chief strategist steve bannon would serve as ?equal partners? in implementing his agenda.the gossip intensified rapidly a week ago, when scaramucci was appointed as communications director despite priebus?s objections. the former wall street banker claimed they were ?like brothers? but tensions soon flared.scaramucci clearly suspected priebus of leaking information to the media. this led him to call the new yorker and give an interview in which he described priebus as ?a fucking paranoid schizophrenic? who would soon be asked to resign.on tuesday, trump told the wall street journal on tuesday that no staff shakeup was in the cards. but according to media reports, he privately floated potential replacements including kelly, deputy national security adviser dina powell, chief economic adviser gary cohn and former campaign adviser david urban.in an interview earlier this week, michael steele, predecessor of priebus as chairman of the republican national committee (rnc), said: ?it?s very clear the president has very little confidence in him. reince?s head is on the block, as was sean spicer?s. sean just got up and removed himself before the axe came down.?priebus is the latest casualty in trump?s west wing. others include national security adviser michael flynn, former deputy chief of staff katie walsh, press secretary sean spicer and press aide michael short.priebus went out of his way to appease trump?s insurgent candidacy during the 2016 election campaign. after trump?s victory in the indiana primary and ted cruz?s decision to drop out, priebus declared trump the presumptive nominee, though ohio governor john kasich was still in the race, and then used the full muscle of the rnc to quash efforts to deny trump the republican nomination at the party convention in cleveland.he also went in person to trump tower in 2015 for trump to sign a loyalty oath to the republican party, a deeply unusual step for an rnc chair to court such a recalcitrant candidate.kelly, meanwhile, has been arguably trump?s favourite cabinet secretary and is leading efforts to build a wall on the mexican border. kelly ran the us southern command, which includes the military prison at guantánamo bay. in 2010, his son, lt robert michael kelly, was killed after stepping on a landmine in afghanistan.in a memorial day speech at arlington national cemetery earlier this year, trump said: ?i especially want to extend our gratitude to secretary john kelly for joining us today. incredible man. i always like to call him general. he understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war.?kelly said in a statement he was honoured to be asked to serve as chief of staff, adding praise for the staff of the homeland security department: ?when i left the marines, i never thought i would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals. i was wrong. you accomplish great things every day defending our nation and i know your exceptional work will continue.?kelly?s appointment leaves a gap at the department of homeland security. claire mccaskill, the top-ranking democrat on the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee, said: ?general kelly has a long history of service to our country and i had a good working relationship with him as secretary of the department of homeland security. with the threats facing this nation, i urge the president to nominate a qualified secretary to replace general kelly as quickly as possible.?in a week of exceptional turmoil, trump has also turned his ire on jeff sessions, the attorney general, accusing him of weakness for recusing himself from the investigation into the trump campaign?s alleged collusion with russia.",SUBJECTIVE,0.7998225688934326

by uzzaman. the blogpost, which said uzzaman pressured the author to go to his hotel room after a business meeting, was written by brandon katayama hill, founder and ceo of a san francisco branding and marketing agency called btrax that competes with fenox, according to the suit. uzzaman?s attorneys said the blogpost was traced to the ip address of hill?s home. reached for comment on thursday, hill denied that he was the author of the post, claiming that other people had access to his wifi and that he did not know who wrote it. the lawsuit comes at a time when women across silicon valley have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment following a viral account of misconduct and discrimination at uber. over the past month, there has been increasing scrutiny of venture capitalists following a series of stories alleging that powerful male investors have repeatedly harassed women seeking startup funding, who are particularly vulnerable and have few recourses to raise concerns when they are mistreated or assaulted by vcs.uzzaman?s lawyers have alleged that hill took advantage of the discussion about discrimination in the industry to target a rival. ?to have these false accusations come particularly in this climate when there?s this growing awareness of a problem that does exist, it?s damaging,?

vc at a local startup event and that he asked her to meet and talk about business. the vc invited the woman to go on a trip with her and stay at a five-star hotel, and when she refused, he said: ?you are going to lose the biggest opportunity if you do not come,?

?a lot of people from japan, including students, and many very cute girls come to him, and he takes advantage of them,? said the blogpost, which was written in japanese and translated to english in the complaint. the blog did not name uzzaman but he was easily identifiable, according to the complaint. there are only a few silicon valley companies that do venture capital services for japan, and fenox is the only firm which has a non-japanese leader with ?dark skin? who is fluent in japanese, as the blog outlined, the suit said. the comments section referenced fenox and uzzaman, according to the complaint. a japanese court eventually ordered hatena to produce the ip address traced to the article, and attorneys confirmed through comcast that the post, published on a saturday morning, was linked to the home address of hill, the suit said. hill?s company has offices in california and japan and operates in the ?same general domain? as uzzaman?s firm, working with startups funded by japanese corporations, the complaint said.hill also used to run a san francisco startup competition called japan night, and fenox venture capital last year launched a similar event called startup world cup. the blogpost was published weeks before the event.?this event is very important to them. for this to have come out just before ?

vandermeyden began at tesla in 2013 and was eventually promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in the general assembly department, which consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over, according to her complaint. it?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to haveit was common for her to be the only woman in meetings with 40 to 50 men, she said on a recent morning, seated in the living room of her family?s house in san carlos, the city where tesla was founded, located across the bay from its current factory in fremont.currently, all chief executive positions are held by men at tesla, and out of more than 30 vice-presidents, only two are women, she added. ?it?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have.?vandermeyden said that when complaints arise at tesla about workplace issues or inequality, the response is often: ??we?re focused on making cars. we don?t have time to deal with all this other stuff.??tesla, founded in 2003, has gained international recognition for its battery-powered vehicles and ?autonomous? driving technology, promoted by musk, the ambitious entrepreneur who makes headlines for bold pledges about space travel, artificial intelligence, underground tunnels and driverless cars.but vandermeyden?s complaint, filed last fall, alleges that there were inadequacies in the quality testing of cars, and that she raised issues about the flaws she observed, which supervisors and male engineers had missed. although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions above her, her lawyers wrote. she and other female engineers were denied promotions even though they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men, according to the complaint. at the same time, she also experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?, the lawsuit said. vandermeyden recounted to the guardian an incident in 2015 when she said a group of roughly 20 men standing on a platform above her and a female colleague began taunting as they walked past. ?they all started hooting and hollering and whistling,? she said. ?that can?t happen without somebody noticing ? it?s disturbing.? but her objections about sexual harassment and unequal pay only caused her more trouble, according to her complaint. the lawsuit alleges that after she raised concerns in the fall of 2015, management told her that in order to advance her position, she needed to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was unattainable and not expected of male engineers. despite positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department where she continues to work today, according to her suit. the lawsuit said tesla also denied her overtime pay, rest breaks and meal periods when she worked in sales, and retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower? when she raised concerns about cars ?sold in a defective state?.some of her claims of mistreatment echo those that have recently emerged from tesla factory workers, who allege that they have to work long hours for low wages in unsafe conditions. musk has vigorously denied those claims and criticized an effort by workers to unionize. tesla initially declined to respond to the guardian?s questions about vandermeyden?s claims, but after publication of this report, released a statement on tuesday defending its actions and refuting her allegations. a spokesperson said that tesla had hired a ?neutral third party? last year to investigate her accusations and that an ?exhaustive review of the facts? concluded her ?claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated?.the company added in its statement: ?tesla is committed to creating a positive workplace environment that is free of discrimination for all our employees.?therese lawless, vandermeyden?s lawyer, criticized the investigation, saying, ?we did not believe that it was a comprehensive report ... we vehemently disagree with their finding.?vandermeyden?s suit said she has suffered ?mental distress? and ?humiliation?.in an interview, she said it takes a toll on her knowing that her work is undervalued. ?equal pay is something that is essentially in the back of your mind every single day,? she said. ?you have all these data points showing how you?ve exceeded some of the predecessors and improved on the system. it wears on you.? it?s very difficult for women to come forward. they?re concerned that their career is going to be jeopardizedmany women in similar positions choose not to speak up, lawless said. ?it?s very difficult for women to come forward. they?re concerned that their career is going to be hindered or jeopardized.? for those who do raise complaints, dealing with hr can be a painful struggle, added lawless, who represented former reddit ceo ellen pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield & byers.?most of my clients come in and say, ?human resources isn?t helping me. they?re just protecting the company.?? vandermeyden recently took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the model s tesla car and has a reservation for the upcoming model 3. she is hopeful her lawsuit and public comments won?t end her career at a company she loves: ?i think they?re a revolutionary and innovative company.?but she admitted she has doubts about her future. ?half the time when i walk into work, i wonder if my badge is going to work.?

as the rightwing government pushes for changes that critics say would make judicial independence a ?pure fiction?.?for over a year i have been repeating that the courts are easily turned into a plaything in the hands of politicians,? ma?gorzata gersdorf told her colleagues in an open letter read out at a recent gathering of judges in warsaw. ?what was until now a threat is becoming a reality.?in its latest battle with poland?s legal system, the ruling law and justice party (pis) says it wants to ?democratise? the way polish judges are appointed, which at the moment is a job for the national council of the judiciary (krs), an autonomous body whose judicial members are chosen by their peers.under the government?s proposals, however, the terms of all the judicial members of the council would be terminated within 90 days of the draft law?s enactment. their replacements would be selected by the polish parliament, with the speaker of the parliament given discretion as to which candidates should be put forward for consideration.whereas the council?s judicial members presently enjoy a majority, under the government?s proposals the body would be split into two chambers, one for judicial members and the other for political representatives. both chambers would have to agree to an appointment or a resolution, giving the political representatives a veto over decisions made by the judicial members.?the government?s proposals will be an instrument for ensuring the appointment of the ?right? kind of judges who will not be too critical of the authorities and their political programme,? said ewa ??towska, a professor at poland?s institute of legal sciences and a former judge who served on the country?s constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court.the council was given less than three working days to respond to the draft act, receiving it from the ministry of justice on a thursday and expected to provide its official response by the following tuesday. in a strongly worded statement, it described the proposals as ?in obvious and gross contradiction with the polish constitution?.?the council is an independent constitutional organ that was instituted in 1989 in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, because in the communist era everything was dependent on the ruling party,? dariusz zawistowski, chairman of the krs and a serving supreme court judge, told the guardian.?when members of the council are elected by the parliament, this function of safeguarding the constitution will be pure fiction. formally speaking, there would be no independent judiciary.?gersdorf has urged her fellow judges to risk their own positions in the fight against the proposals.?there is no fight without victims, and among them may be counted some of us present here,? said gersdorf?s letter to her fellow judges. ?to win, you must be prepared even for disciplinary tribunals, to be removed from office, for anything. you must show that we are in opposition to the pushing of a democratic state into oblivion.?the government describes the proposals as ?enhancing democracy and independence? by freeing the appointments process from ?the corporate interests of the judicial environment?, citing the judicial appointments process in countries such as spain and germany.?objectivity in selecting members of the national council of the judiciary and their independence from corporate interests is to be ensured by them being selected by the sejm, which holds a mandate gained in democratic elections. a similar system is successful for instance in spain,? said the ministry of justice in a statement.but the krs?s response rejects such comparisons. ?it must be recalled that in accordance with article 8(1) of the constitution, it is the constitution of the republic of poland of 2 april 1997 that is the supreme law in the republic of poland, and not the constitution of spain of 31 october 1978 or the basic law of the federal republic of germany of 23 may 1949.?the controversy is the latest front in a protracted battle between the pis and an increasingly demoralised judiciary.shortly after assuming power in late 2015, the government merged the office of prosecutor general with that of the justice minister, zbigniew ziobro, a move that some analysts argue has already allowed the government to exert political pressure on judges.?we have already seen numerous examples of prosecutors answerable to the minister of justice initiating criminal proceedings against judges who have reached decisions they don?t agree with,?

by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.bt said it expected to pay out £300m in compensation to rivals including sky, vodafone and talktalk for the ?serious breach? of ofcom?s rules.?the size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses,? said gaucho rasmussen, investigations director at ofcom. ?our message is clear ? we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. millions of people rely on bt?s network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.?compensation must be paid to affected providers within 12 months, ofcom said.the record £42m penalty, which was reduced from £60m after bt admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than 11 times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by ofcom. last year, vodafone was fined £3.7m for taking pay-as-you-go customers? money without providing a service. bt?s fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the £5.7m itv had to pay in 2008 over the ?abuse? of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows.ofcom?s investigation into bt focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between january 2013 and december 2014. it was instigated after a complaint from vodafone, which relies on bt ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. vodafone accused openreach of failing to meet its 30-day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation.?these high-speed lines are a vital part of this country?s digital backbone,? said rasmussen. ?we found bt broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.?bt was also fined £300,000 for ?failing to provide information to ofcom?.?we apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections,?

revealed we fell short of the high standards we expect in serving our communications provider customers,? patterson said. ?we take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again. my management team and i are determined that bt applies the highest standards when serving our customers.?this month bt, which is to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied it was forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new £1.2bn champions league football rights deal.",SUBJECTIVE,0.525056004524231

Deepali Aggarwal,27 Jul 2017,man tipped as china's next president faces corruption probe,www.theguardian.com,"top communist party of china politician sun zhengcai, who was considered a potential successor to president xi jinping, is reportedly being investigated for corruption by his party. the probe against zhengcai, who was recently ejected from his role as party's secretary for chongqing city, eliminates him from the contest to become china's next president.","he studied agriculture in rural england and was tipped by some as china?s future leader.but on tuesday morning sun zhengcai?s political obituary was splashed across the front page of the communist party?s official mouthpiece in a damning editorial entitled: ?rule strictly over the party with iron discipline.??the investigation into comrade sun zhengcai sounds the alarm bell for the party,? the people?s daily article warned, as it announced that the youngest member of china?s political elite had been ejected from power for a ?serious violation of discipline?.?top cadres must hold firm political positions, temper their political characters ? and act in a manner consistent with the party?s central committee with [president] xi jinping as its core,? the broadsheet declared. just a few weeks ago, sun, a 53-year-old former agriculture minister who studied farming at hertfordshire?s rothamstad research centre in the 1990s, was the high-flying party chief of one of the world?s fastest-growing cities, the sweltering yangtze port of chongqing.many believed he was being groomed for greatness and would use that job ? handed to him in late 2012 after the sensational downfall of flamboyant party leader bo xilai ? as a springboard from which to leap into one of seven highly-coveted spots on china?s top ruling body, the politburo standing committee. places on that elite council will be up for grabs later this year when chinese leaders flock to beijing for their quinquennial enclave, the 19th communist party congress.such a promotion would likely have put sun ? part of the so-called sixth generation of post-revolution leaders ? in line to succeed either xi or premier li keqiang at the next party congress in 2022.but xi?s unforeseen decision to purge sun has shredded not only those expectations but also the playbook governing how one-party china conducts political leadership successions. in doing so, some experts fear xi may also have set in motion a new phase of political turbulence in the world?s number two economy.?a smooth leadership transition is really crucial to the survival of chinese communist party rule in china and this really throws a monkey wrench into the machine,? said susan shirk, a us expert in elite chinese politics who was deputy assistant secretary of state under bill clinton.shirk said that for almost two decades china?s rulers had abided by an unofficial succession system designed to prevent both cut-throat and destabilising internecine power struggles and the rise of strongman dictators who could cling to power until they died or were violently overthrown.according to those unwritten rules, presumptive heirs to the communist party?s top two jobs, general secretary and premier, should be informally anointed five years ahead of a full leadership transition, as had happened with xi and li in 2007. some had seen sun as one of those two likely heirs ? the other was guangdong party chief hu chunhua, who remains in power ? and the decision to bring him down now brought ?intense uncertainty about how the game will be played in the future?, shirk said. ?i think that has got to make the people at the top ranks of the chinese communist party very uneasy about the risks that presents.?as with much about chinese politics, the exact nature of sun?s alleged crimes remains murky, as does the political rationale behind his defenestration.the first hint of his undoing came when one of xi?s feared corruption-busting teams descended on chongqing late last year. in its subsequent report the group accused his administration of failing to eliminate the poisonous and pernicious ?ideological legacy? of bo xilai, a bitter xi rival, who had been ousted five years earlier after the murder of british businessman neil heywood sparked china?s biggest political scandal in decades. then, in mid-july, came the unexpected and unexplained announcement that sun had been replaced by a xi loyalist who vowed to purify the city?s ?political ecosystem?. sun is rumoured to have been taken into custody while attending a conference in beijing.cheng li, the director of the brookings institute?s china center, said it was unclear if sun was facing accusations of corruption or political offences such as conspiring against xi: ?it could be either ? or both.?many believe xi, who some suspect hopes to stay in power beyond 2022, viewed sun as a power-hungry competitor who had to be eliminated. li, an authority on the communist party?s elite, said that even before the purge: ?i have talked to many people who know sun [and they said] ? ?that guy has a very strong personal ambition; you simply cannot believe what he says and what he promises?.?in chinese, you use the term ?yóu? [slippery or cunning].?bill bishop, the publisher of the influential sinocism newsletter, said sun?s demise was further proof that xi ? who took power in 2012 and has been called china?s most dominant leader since mao ? was a masterful and steely political strategist.as he sought to cement his status as china?s omnipotent ?chairman of everything?, xi was using anti-corruption investigators to pick off rivals, who were replaced with supporters. sun?s successor in chongqing, chen min?er, who worked under xi during his five years as zhejiang province?s party boss, now appears poised to claim a seat at the party?s top table at this autumn?s congress.?xi certainly looks like he would make machiavelli ? and mao ? quite proud,? bishop said.shirk, the chair of the 21st century china centre at the university of california, san diego, said she saw sun?s downfall not as as sign of xi?s strength, but of the fragility of china?s political system. ?if [xi] upturns the smooth succession now, i think he?s setting himself up for trouble, for some pushback from the rest of the party elite.?if they feel they are being put at risk and the whole party is being put at risk by a leader who is trying to claim too much of the power and privilege for himself, then i think there is a risk.?i?m not saying it is necessarily an elite coup or something like that, but it could be.?for sun zhengcai, there is little doubt what now lies ahead.?he?ll end up in jail,? said li.additional reporting by wang zhen",NEUTRAL,0.6341865062713623

science and technology committee having called for an end to their prescription on nhs, pointing out that such remedies are merely placebos. the new guidelines were welcomed by experts.?homeopathy is based on implausible assumptions and the most reliable evidence fails to show that it works beyond a placebo effect. it can cause severe harm when used as an alternative to effective treatments,? said edzard ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the university of exeter. ?therefore, it is high time that the nhs stops funding it and instead employs our scarce resources on treatments that are backed by sound science.?the view was echoed by michael marshall, project director of the good thinking society, an organisation that previously threatened the department of health with a judicial review if it failed to put complementary and alternative therapies on the blacklist for prescriptions.?this is very welcome news,?

she said.meanwhile, nhs england has been accused of introducing ?ability to pay? through the back door by forcing patients to pay for other products it claims are ?ineffective, over-priced and low value?, instead of giving prescriptions for them. health charities claim the nhs is abandoning the historic principle that people who need care should not have to pay. the charge has been made today by national voices, an umbrella group that represents 140 health and care charities including the british heart foundation, parkinson?s uk and arthritis care. it was responding to nhs england?s announcement that it wants to cut its drugs bill by several hundred million pounds by no longer issuing prescriptions for cough mixture, cold treatments, eye drops, laxatives and sun cream ? products that are available over the counter. nhs bosses want those in need to pay for such medications themselves. ?there are many patients who would be unable to afford the remedies over the counter ? for example people who are exempt from prescription charges such as the under-16s, people living with cancer, pregnant women and those on low incomes?, said don redding, national voices? director of policy. ?stopping such prescriptions would be tantamount to introducing ?ability to pay?

and a century after the fashion bible was founded.with both a style and magazine described as a ?very british?, shulman?s departure also marks the end of a rivalry much-loved by fashion journalists between her and the equally british anna wintour, editor-in-chief of us vogue and said to be the model for the terrifying meryl streep character in the devil wears prada.in departing, shulman indicated that recent ventures beyond the magazine ? a behind-the-scenes bbc documentary, absolutely fashion, and a well-received book, inside vogue: a diary of my 100th year ? had made her realise there was a life beyond a magazine she had edited since the age of 34.?i realised that i very much wanted to experience a different life and look forward to a future separate to vogue,? she said.during shulman?s tenure at vogue ? circulation has increased 12% to 195,053 in the past 25 years ? she has championed both british fashion and london fashion week, now one of the ?big four? fashion events.she has a reputation for supporting british designers without quite fitting the image of a perfectly stylish fashion editor. while other international vogue editors such as wintour in the us and carine roitfeld in france are considered icy style icons, shulman laughingly told the guardian of being presented in one feature as the ?chain-smoking 50-year-old toyota-driving divorcee?.when she was appointed it was suggested that she ?could become better acquainted with a hairbrush?, according to the new york times. but shulman used her reputation to define her magazine. ?she was never starry in a very conscious way. it was quite british, just like her magazine,? said one senior colleague.while us vogue is known for its glossy and expensive us sportswear shoots, the british edition is considered more creative and original, even bohemian. although the rivalry with wintour is real, according to magazine insiders, it is entirely professional. in the bbc documentary shulman is shown scooping a planned wintour exclusive by putting rihanna on the cover. ?it?s all journalistic pride. they get on fine,? said one senior colleague.plum sykes, contributing editor of us vogue who started her career as a junior assistant under shulman in the 1990s, said: ?she is very british, very laid-back. i am sure her manolos are muddy. but she has done a good job, especially for british fashion.?shulman has said: ?it does amaze me when people say ?well, you don?t look like the editor of vogue?. because i am the editor of vogue. so what else does the editor of vogue look like??in an interview with the observer she also talked openly about using xanax to deal with panic attacks. given that her life might appear ?sort of lovely and easy?

when she was appointed.despite this, she has always told interviewers that having two parents who were journalists meant she had ?wanted to be a hairdresser?, or a musician.in 2015 she wrote about how glad she was to return to work when her only son, now 21 and a history of art student, was 15 weeks old.although she has refused to publish articles lauding diets or cosmetic surgery, vogue has been no stranger to controversy. in the early 1990s a kate moss shoot was criticised for encouraging ?heroin chic? and in 1997, the watchmaker omega pulled an ad campaign because of the issue.early on, shulman appeared to dismiss these complaints by saying ?not many people have actually said to me that they have looked at my magazine and decided to become anorexic.?but in 2009, she wrote a letter to major international fashion houses complaining that their ?minuscule? sample sizes were forcing fashion editors to use models with ?jutting bones?. her january 2017 issue featured a plus-size model, ashley graham, on the cover.on the weight issue, she said: ?what is an issue is to try to make young women feel more comfortable with how they look in general and not feel they have to look a cookie-cutter way to be a success in life. that?s really what i?m interested in.?",NEUTRAL,0.9689475297927856

Anmol Sharma,24 Jul 2017,"froome wins 4th tour de france, finishes race in under 87hrs",www.theguardian.com,"british cyclist chris froome won his third consecutive and fourth overall tour de france, finishing the race in 86 hours 20 minutes 55 seconds in paris on sunday. the 32-year-old rider, who finished the event with a 54-second lead, has moved within one win of the all-time record. the 3,540-km 23-day long grand tour, featured a total of 198 riders.","the french capital was in lockdown on sunday, with extra rings of security around the champs Élysées, which had been turned into a vast sterile zone as a foretaste of what awaits the french capital when the olympics arrive in either 2024 or 2028. in an understandable attempt to put paris on display as never before, the race was routed through the grand palais with the riders racing under the famous glass roof, originally erected in 1897 for the universal exposition of the turn of the century.for chris froome it was but a novel diversion en route to confirmation of his fourth tour de france victory. the team sky rider crossed the line in the bunch behind the stage winner, dylan groenewegen, to win the yellow jersey by 54 seconds from rigoberto urán.bike races have been sent through buildings before ? there is a legendary kermis in belgium which went through a bar full of drinkers and cyclo-cross races are sometimes sent through beer tents ? but this was about more than merely upping the returns in adjacent brasseries. coming as it did the day after the start and finish in marseille?s stade vélodrome ? albeit far from full due to the fact that few ticket holders wanted to stay in the stands all day ? the grand palais detour was further evidence that the tour is constantly looking for new ways to reinvent itself, and a reminder that it increasingly sees itself as a way of showing this multifaceted country to the world.lockdown could serve as a metaphor for the tour as a whole, given the way the overall battle had panned out since the race left düsseldorf 22 days ago. in four of the five previous tours, team sky had brought their cycling version of catenaccio to bear on the race, but they had never done so to the extent they managed this year, with the yellow jersey only eluding them for two days once geraint thomas had won the opening time trial. for kilometre after kilometre the white train ground out the pace on the front, up hill and down dale, at times lining out the entire race when on paper it was not strictly necessary.as froome?s fourth win loomed large, it was inevitable that at least one french newspaper ? le figaro, as it turned out ? would describe the tour winner using antoine blondin?s sublime pun, ?gérant de la route? ? a wordplay on the verb gérer, meaning to manage or regulate, and the hoary french cliche for the tour riders, les géants de la route. an english translation might be accountancy on wheels. or to paraphrase geoff nicholson, hoarding seconds like supermarket discount coupons.froome himself said that this was his and team sky?s chosen approach. ?we knew in düsseldorf that it would be tight. it was always the tactic to ride this as a three-week race, not to go out on one day to blow it up, smash it for the stage win ? just chipping away every stage to make sure there were no massive losses. that?s normal when on a bad day in the mountains you can lose minutes. it?s been about doing it in the most conservative and efficient manner. that?s what grand tour racing is.?compare and contrast with dan martin, who treats the key days like individual one-day classics, but ? before you veer too strongly towards espousing martin?s philosophy ? bear in mind who actually won.fourth tour wins are the penultimate step to cycling greatness, but often do little to warm the soul at the time. this could certainly be said of the three that i can personally recall: lance armstrong in 2002 (with the usual proviso that it has been struck off), miguel indurain in 1994 and bernard hinault in 1982. they seem to be ones for the record books rather than the heart, but they can be turned by an individual?s approach. hinault, in 1982, faced the same issue that confronted froome as he approached paris on sunday: a tour without a stage win, and the consequent carps about a lack of panache.the badger?s response was to win the bunch sprint on the champs Élysées, but this is not one from the froome copybook. having said that, froome?s great strength over his four victories is his ability to adapt to whatever the tour organisers present to him, and whatever fate decrees. 2013 had a wealth of time trialling and an immensely tough finale in the alps; in 2015 there were cobbles and a team time trial but barely any individual time trials, while in 2016 there was more time trialling and a downhill finale into morzine, in teeming rain, not to mention the run up mont ventoux.he is a champion who has versatility and grit, if not charisma or popularity. his approach to the latter is summed up by his answer to the question of why he felt he did not need to give press conferences on the rest days. ?rest days are meant to be rest days and a big press conference is not good for recovery. i felt it helped me being able to switch off.? if froome chooses to pursue a ?marginal gain? by hiding from a 15-minute discussion with the people whose job it is to present his personality to the world, he can hardly complain if his personality is not understood or appreciated for what it is. this is the team sky approach of winning at all costs; in this case the cost has to be borne by him.for the neutral there was much unbridled bike racing by individuals of character and panache to be savoured through the 2017 tour, with the unfortunate proviso that very little of it actually involved the battle for the overall title. some days will live in the memory: the moyenne montagne stage to les rousses won by lilian calmejane, steve cummings?s attempt to take the stage to peyragudes, sunweb?s battle with quick-step on the road to romans-sur-isère on behalf of their sprinters mike matthews and marcel kittel, alberto contador?s raging against the dying of the light en route to foix and serre-chevalier, and edvald boasson hagen?s cunning on friday at salon-de-provence.two stages can be seen as key episodes in the picaresque three-week soap opera: the düsseldorf time trial, because of the time gained by froome, and the message it sent about the probable outcome in marseille three weeks later, and chambéry, with the crash that eliminated richie porte ? whose bmc team looked second strongest to sky ? and which put daniel martin physically and temporally on the back foot for the rest of the race.what of the opposition? they fell upon a froome who was probably not as strong as in the past, but who had the nous, the sangfroid and the team to get him cycling?s greatest prize. ?at the moment we?re not ready to beat chris froome. most teams aren?t,? said orica-scott?s director sportive matt white, who placed a yates brother in the top 10 and the white jersey of best under-25 for the second year running.?we?ll be coming back with a leader next year to try to beat chris. everyone is beatable. the model that sky run and how they race makes it difficult. i?ve no idea what it?s a sign of but this year in general we haven?t seen him at the level of the past. that level was still good enough to win the tour de france, and that shows the class of the man.?",NEUTRAL,0.9919849634170532

federer will face stan wawrinka in the semi-finals ? his 13th trip to the last four in melbourne in 14 years.here?s federer courtside with jim courier: ?i thought i was maybe going to win a few rounds, maybe get to the fourth round, quarters, depending on the draw. then when i saw the draw ? i didn?t see a dream draw at all. i didn?t expect to play this well. ?stan is a clutch player. he?s won a slam the last three years. i?ve just got to stay aggressive, the more time i give him the better he is.?

well, that was about as emphatic as you can get. zverev momentarily looked in the match in the second set but in general he was utterly overwhelmed by federer, who was imperious.

third set: zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-6 federer* (*denotes server)an ace takes federer to 30-0 in a flash but a fine zverev return brings it back to 30-15 and federer nets a forehand for 30-30. he follows that up by netting a routine volley. zverev has an unlikely break point ? and federer crunches down an ace. match point arrives presently and a forehand into the open court gives federer victory.

third set: *zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-5 federer (*denotes server)zverev sends down a couple of unreturnable serves to lead 40-15 but his second serve is letting him down and a gentle federer backhand brings him back to 40-30 before a couple of straightforward passing shots ? at least, he makes them look straightforward ? give him a break point. zverev twice volleys beautifully to save it though. but the german can?t get over the line and nets another volley to bring up a fifth deuce. federer passes him to bring up a second break point ? but an ace saves the day. deuce no6. he misses with a volley ? break point no3. but another fine serve comes to the rescue again. deuce no7. and then deuce no8. break point no4 ? but federer goes a touch long. deuce no9. federer is almost inside the service box on zverev?s second serve as he earns a fifth break point ? but another ace booms down.crikey. deuce no10. zverev nets a forehand volley. break point no6 ? and this time federer backhands down the line for a double break. that game took about as long as the first set.

09:42

third set: zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-4 federer* (*denotes server)federer charges the net and zverev dumps a dejected backhand to give the swiss a 30-15 lead. and two points later federer has the hold. zverev looks truly broken now.

9.40am gmt
09:40

third set: *zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-3 federer (*denotes server)zverev goes 30-0 up but is again passed twice at the net ? at times he looks like a man at a bus stop watching perplexed and stranded as the no91 zooms past him without stopping ? as federer brings us back to 30-30. federer soon has a break point but zverev scrambles to bring up deuce. zverev takes the advantage but then there?s probably the rally of the match, federer brilliantly hitting two lobs, the first of which is hoiked back in by zverev; the second, a dozen shots later, drops inside the line to give federer the point. and that puts a bit of a pep into the swiss ? a fizzing cross court backhand gives him another break point, one he takes with a ludicrously good backhand down the line. zverev, at the net on both occasions, can only watch on with admiration.

9.34am gmt
09:34

third set: zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-2 federer* (*denotes server)zverev makes a rare excursion to the net on the federer serve and gets passed for his troubles. another utterly straightforward hold.

9.31am gmt
09:31

third set: *zverev 1-6, 5-7, 2-1 federer (*denotes server)it?s all gone a little flat out on rod laver ? the crowd have stopped believing in this as a contest, while zverev has only sporadically suggested he believes in it himself. federer brings up 30-30 with two passing shots as zverev looks on helplessly at the net but a nice deep volley from the next points takes him to 40-30 and federer goes long from the next.

9.27am gmt
09:27

third set: zverev 1-6, 5-7, 1-1 federer* (*denotes server)the most routine of routine holds for federer.

9.26am gmt
09:26

third set: *zverev 1-6, 5-7, 1-0 federer (*denotes server)deuce on the zverev serve and a cracking passing shot gives federer a break point. the world no50 saves it with a ferocious serve and a controlled volley. another excellent volley gives him the advantage and a point later he has the hold. it?s far from straightforward for the german at the moment though.

@john_ashdown do you think it's possible to watch fedex and not call in love?there?s just something in the way he moves isn?t there? federer is almost exactly six months younger than your correspondent ? i move like the tin man filled with concrete, he moves like some sort of sentient liquid.

9.20am gmt
09:20

second set: zverev 1-6, 5-7 federer* (*denotes server)a extraordinary, barely believable, cross-court forehand kisses the line to take federer 30-0 up and within the blink of an eye he has two set points. a wonderful volley from the german keeps him in it at 40-30 but he follows that up with an errant return and federer leads two sets to love.

9.17am gmt
09:17

second set: *zverev 1-6, 5-6 federer (*denotes server)this is exactly the point that you?d expect federer to crank through the gears and he duly does so. at 0-15 federer sends a return skidding onto zverev?s toes and the big man can only dump the ball into the net. 0-30. and that soon becomes 0-40 as federer gets the better of a close-quarters exchange at the net. three break points. federer needs just won, passing zverev with ease as the german?s volley sits up to be hit. federer will serve for the second set.

9.14am gmt
09:14

second set: zverev 1-6, 5-5 federer* (*denotes server)so federer serves to stay in the second set. zverev seems content to sit at the back of the court on the federer serve now, tempting federer to attack the net. which he does without success on this occasion ? zverev leads 15-30. a weak return from the german allows federer to go cross-court for 30-30 a long return makes it 40-30, and an ace gives federer the hold.

9.10am gmt
09:10

second set: *zverev 1-6, 5-4 federer (*denotes server)at 30-0 federer misses with the most routine of forehands and an ace brings zverev a routine hold. the german is still on the back foot in the main but it?s chalk-and-cheese from the first set.

9.08am gmt
09:08

second set: zverev 1-6, 4-4 federer* (*denotes server)federer cruises into a 30-0 lead but zverev battles back to 30-30 with the help of his strangely punched forehand (he almost shovels the balls over the net rather than take a full swing). again from that point though, federer takes control.

9.04am gmt
09:04

second set: *zverev 1-6, 4-3 federer (*denotes server)zverev booms down an ace to hold to 15.in other news, andy murray is not in the gb davis cup squad:

9.02am gmt
09:02

second set: zverev 1-6, 3-3 federer* (*denotes server)the points here are flying by so quickly it?s hard to keep up. essentially the shape of the match is as follows ? zverev is at the net; if his approach shot is awkward for federer then zverev tends to win the point with a volley; if his approach shot is anything other than excellent then federer wins with a passing shot or by sending a ferocious drive into the body of his opponent.federer is also attacking the net on occasion ? he does so at 30-0 but is beaten by a fine passing shot, then a long baseline rally ? the longest of the match ? ends with federer netting a backhand. from 30-all, though, federer steps on the accelerator again and holds with ease.

8.58am gmt
08:58

second set: *zverev 1-6, 3-2 federer (*denotes server)federer earns two break points ? he can?t beat zverev with a lob from the first but hammers a backhand at the body of his opponent to take the second. we?re back on serve.

8.56am gmt
08:56

second set: zverev 1-6, 3-1 federer* (*denotes server)we have a match now! zverev breaks to love. all of a sudden, federer isn?t getting those easy passing opportunities and on the occasions when the swiss comes to the net, zverev is making life very awkward.

8.52am gmt
08:52

second set: *zverev 1-6, 2-1 federer (*denotes server)the point of the match comes at 30-0 with zverev being peppered at the net by federer but coping admirably and finally winning the point with his third successive volley. a hold to love.

8.51am gmt
08:51

second set: zverev 1-6, 1-1 federer* (*denotes server)this is better from zverev, a cracking forehand down the line takes him 15-30 up on the federer serve. but a couple of thumping federer backhands help him back to 40-30 and the deepest of deep forehand just kisses the line to give federer the hold.

8.47am gmt
08:47

second set: *zverev 1-6, 1-0 federer (*denotes server)federer nets a forehand as zverev finally finds a bit of venom in his serve and the german player has his nose ahead in the second set.

8.44am gmt
08:44

first set: zverev 1-6 federer* (*denotes server)that game ends a run of 18 (at least) straight games for federer against this opponent. zverev digs in for 30-30 but another straightforward winner gives federer his first set point ? but he makes a rare error, straying wide on his forehand. an ace and a serve-volley of his own brings federer the first set. it took just 19 minutes.

8.40am gmt
08:40

first set: *zverev 1-5 federer (*denotes server)so the underdog can?t compete from the baseline and his serve-volley game is being completely undermined by federer?s returning. he looked tentative from the off and now he looks shellshocked. another volley off the frame at the net at least gives him a 15-0 lead this time and, after another federer pass, an ace takes us to 30-15. federer fails to return another booming serve but then a zverev volley goes long ? 40-30. but federer goes long with his return from the next and zverev is on the board.

8.37am gmt
08:37

first set: zverev 0-5 federer* (*denotes server)zverev already looks a beaten man. federer holds to love.

8.35am gmt
08:35

first set: *zverev 0-4 federer (*denotes server)federer races into a 40-0 lead, with zverev left helpless at the net by his opponent?s brilliant returning. the german?s second shot is continually a desperate pop into the middle of the court, giving federer all the time he needs to find the passing shot or a lob. another break to 15.

8.32am gmt
08:32

first set: zverev 0-3 federer* (*denotes server)zverev sprints into a 0-30 lead, courtesy of a slightly fortunate framed-volley at the net. federer responds with an ace before charging the net himself and forcing zverev to go long. the baseline rallies are complete one-way traffic ? with zverev pinned to the back of the court federer rattles through another two points and holds once more.

8.29am gmt
08:29

first set: *zverev 0-2 federer (*denotes server)a couple of successful serve-volleys take zverev 30-0 up but he nets the next attempt and federer passes him with a beautiful backhand to bring up 30-all before pinging a forehand cross court to bring a first break point. and federer needs no second invitation, putting his return onto zverev?s toes and then hammering another forehand cross-court past his opponent. an early break.

8.26am gmt
08:26

first set: zverev 0-1 federer* (*denotes server)zverev won the toss but opted to receive, interestingly. a couple of spot-on serves give federer a 30-0 lead before zverev dumps a backhand into the net. the german comes to the net at 40-0 down but federer stings his racket with a forehand and it?s a straightforward hold for the swiss.

the bad news for zverev: in the last 13 australian opens, federer has reached 12 semi-finals. and on both occasions these players have previously met, federer has won in straight sets.and on the most recent of those occasions, in halle in 2013, federer was a 6-0, 6-0 winner.and the swiss master has been in superb form in melbourne, crushing tomas berdych in round three and coming through a thrilling five-setter with kei nishikori in the last 16.the good news? well, this is already zverev?s best run at a grand slam, eclipsing his run to the third round of wimbledon in 2008. and he was brilliant against murray.updated

Animesh Choudhary,24 Jan 2017,parliament vote required for starting brexit process: uk sc,www.theguardian.com,"the british government must hold a vote in both houses of the parliament before starting the process of leaving the european union, the country's supreme court ruled on tuesday. uk prime minister theresa may had earlier promised lawmakers a vote on the outcome of the brexit talks, but had hoped to trigger the talks without parliamentary approval.","the government has lost its fast-tracked appeal to the supreme court, forcing ministers to introduce emergency legislation into parliament to authorise the uk?s departure from the eu.in a judgment that sets a far-reaching constitutional precedent and upholds parliamentary sovereignty, the court ruled by a majority of eight justices to three that mps and peers must give their consent before the government can trigger article 50 and formally initiate brexit.the decision sets clear limits on the extent of the government?s executive powers. rights embedded in the law by the 1972 european communities act, which took the uk into what was then the european community, cannot be removed by the government?s prerogative powers, a majority of the justices declared.the eagerly awaited ruling by the largest panel of judges ever assembled in britain?s highest court routes the protracted brexit process through parliament, handing over to mps and peers the authority to sanction the uk?s withdrawal.the supreme court ruled that there was no need for the government to wait for consent from the devolved assemblies in scotland, northern ireland and wales. although the ruling represents a blow to theresa may?s intended timetable on brexit, a downing street spokesman said the ruling had not changed the verdict of the british people. ?it?s important to remember that parliament backed the referendum by a margin of six to one and has already indicated its support for getting on with the process of exit to the timetable we have set out,? a spokesman said. ?we respect the supreme court?s decision, and will set out our next steps to parliament shortly.?the government now has a tight deadline to pass even a short bill through parliament, but it is still possible to meet its article 50 deadline of the end of march. in may?s favour, there is not a large appetite in either the commons or the lords to actively block the process. the snp and lib dems are likely to vote against the bill if their amendments are not passed, and some labour rebels will join them. but labour has no desire to appear to be trying to prevent the referendum result being honoured. the labour leader, jeremy corbyn, said his party would not ?frustrate the process for invoking article 50? but would seek to amend the government?s bill. corbyn said: ?labour will seek to amend the article 50 bill to prevent the conservatives using brexit to turn britain into a bargain basement tax haven off the coast of europe. ?labour will seek to build in the principles of full, tariff-free access to the single market and maintenance of workers? rights and social and environmental protections. ?labour is demanding a plan from the government to ensure it is accountable to parliament throughout the negotiations and a meaningful vote to ensure the final deal is given parliamentary approval.?the leader of the liberal democrats, tim farron, confirmed his party would vote against article 50 unless people were given another vote on the final deal.scotland?s first minister nicola sturgeon, said the ruling showed the promises made to the scottish government on devolution were ?not worth the paper they were written on?. she said the scottish parliament would still have an opportunity to vote on whether it consented to the triggering of article 50.the attorney general, jeremy wright, said the government was ?disappointed? by the supreme court ruling but would comply with it. he said enacting the decision would now be a political and not legal matter and the brexit secretary, david davis, would be making a statement to the commons later on tuesday.gina miller, the investment fund manager who was one of the lead claimants in the challenge, welcomed the ruling, saying: ?no prime minister, no government can expect to be unanswerable or unchallenged. parliament alone is sovereign.? outside the court, she said mps would now have the chance to help the government select the best course in brexit talks. she also spoke of how this ?divisive issue of a generation? had led to her and her legal team facing ?extraordinary and unwarranted criticism?. the justice secretary, liz truss, who faced criticism for not defending the appeal court justices denounced by sections of the media as ?enemies of the people? after they ruled against the government, said: ?our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms. the reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over, and our supreme court justices are people of integrity and impartiality. ?while we may not always agree with judgments, it is a fundamental part of any thriving democracy that legal process is followed. the government has been clear that it will respect the decision of the court.? the president of the supreme court, lord neuberger of abbotsbury, delivered a summary of the decision, which has far-reaching constitutional implications.reading the summary, neuberger said: ?by a majority of eight to three, the supreme court rules that the government cannot trigger article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so.?section 2 of the 1972 [european communities] act provides that, whenever eu institutions make new laws, those new laws become part of uk law. the 1972 act therefore makes eu law an independent source of uk law, until parliament decides otherwise.?therefore, when the uk withdraws from the eu treaties, a source of uk law will be cut off. further, certain rights enjoyed by uk citizens will be changed. therefore, the government cannot trigger article 50 without parliament authorising that course.?neuberger said: ?any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the uk constitution, namely by an act of parliament. to proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries.?the eight to three margin of defeat suffered by the government was bigger than ministers had hoped for. they had already conceded in advance that they would probably lose.the three dissenting justices who found for the government were lords reed, carnwath and hughes. their judgments say that the european communities act did not restrict the government?s use of its prerogative powers and that ministers could withdraw without reference to parliament. the devolved assemblies in edinburgh, belfast and cardiff had argued for a say on the basis of the sewel convention, which provides for them to be consulted on matters that are ?normally? devolved, but they did not win any formal right to participate in the brexit process.neuberger said: ?on the devolution issues, the court unanimously rules that uk ministers are not legally compelled to consult the devolved legislatures before triggering article 50. the devolution statutes were enacted on the assumption that the uk would be a member of the eu, but they do not require it. relations with the eu are a matter for the uk government.?the sewel convention plays an important role in the operation of the uk constitution but the policing of its scope and operation is not a matter for the courts.?paragraph 122 of the 96-page long judgment makes clear that it is up to mps and peers to decide what form the bill put before parliament should take. the majority judgment states: ?what form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for parliament. but, in the light of a point made in oral argument, it is right to add that the fact that parliament may decide to content itself with a very brief statute is nothing to the point. there is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. ?a notice under article 50(2) could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance.?",NEUTRAL,0.6891292333602905

Deepali Aggarwal,23 May 2017,a person displaced every second by crises in 2016: report,www.theguardian.com,"more than 31 million people, that is one person every second, were displaced in their country in 2016 because of conflicts, violence and natural disasters, a norwegian refugee council report has revealed. adding that the democratic republic of the congo was the worst affected country, the report said that natural disasters displaced over three times the number uprooted by conflicts. ","conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than 31 million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.but while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the norwegian refugee council?s internal displacement monitoring centre. alexandra bilak, director of the idmc, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. ?not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you?re missing part of the picture,? she said. ?if you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,? added bilak.last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. worst affected was the democratic republic of the congo, where 922,000 were displaced, a 50% rise on the previous year. close behind was syria (824,000), followed by iraq (659,000), afghanistan (653,000), nigeria (501,000) and yemen (478,000).disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing 24.2 million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. this trend was at its most acute in east asia and the pacific. in china, 7.4 million were forced from their homes, with 5.9 million affected in the philippines and a further 2.4 million in india. floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. in some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report?s authors noted. it pointed to the situations unfolding in nigeria, south sudan and somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. bilak said the number of displacements due to violence in drc was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. ?unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.?in may last year, the un proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030. the report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.?what we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. we just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,? said jan egeland, secretary general of the norwegian refugee council.he said there is a link with refugees ? though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 ? afghanistan, colombia, drc, south sudan and syria ? were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. ?first, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,? he said. ?it?s incredible there?s not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the yemeni conflict. we also need to get economic life to countries like yemen and elsewhere so there?s not a collapse in social structures there. then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.?",SUBJECTIVE,0.5128863453865051
Deepali Aggarwal,23 May 2017,israeli pm orders ministers to attend trump's welcome event,www.theguardian.com,"israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday ordered his cabinet to attend a welcome ceremony for us president donald trump, after discovering that many of them planned to skip the event, reports said. notably, israeli officials have criticised the visit as ""haphazard"". trump arrived in israel on monday in the second leg of his first overseas trip as president. ","israel?s prime minister, benjamin netanyahu, has reportedly been forced to order his ministers to attend the airport reception for donald trump on monday, after discovering that a number had planned not to attend.according to reports in the israeli media, an angry netanyahu was informed on sunday that party heads and a number of ministers planned to skip the reception after the white house had asked for the meet and greet to be shortened to the two countries? anthems and handshakes only between netanyahu and trump.haaretz, the times of israel and the jerusalem post all carried stories, some quoting an identified israeli government official on the instruction from netanyahu, amid claims that ministers had been upset at not being included in the receiving line on the airport tarmac.the row is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the planned visit of the us president, which officials in israel have privately characterised as often haphazard.trump will arrive for the whirlwind visit to israel and to the occupied palestinian territories on monday, amid mounting questions over what ? if any ? practical steps he will take to advance his ?ultimate peace deal? between the two sides.overshadowed by the escalating scandals surrounding him, the us president will meet netanyahu and the palestinian president, mahmoud abbas, during 26 hours of events.trump will arrive from riyadh on air force one just before noon at ben gurion airport, accompanied by his wife, melania, daughter ivanka and son-in-law jared, before flying by helicopter to jerusalem.during his visit, trump will briefly visit the holocaust memorial at yad vashem and the church of the holy sepulchre in the old city, dine with netanyahu and make a private visit to the western wall, judaism?s most holy site. then on tuesday morning trump will meet abbas in bethlehem before flying on to rome.speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on sunday, ahead of trump?s arrival, netanyahu said: ?i will discuss with president trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the united states. we will improve our security ties, which we are strengthening on a daily basis. we will also discuss ways to advance the peace.?the visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures. trump will spend a single night in a suite in the king david hotel protected by glass capable of withstanding a rocket-propelled grenade and a poison gas attack. the visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the six day war in early june ? which for palestinians marks five decades of occupation ? and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of palestinian prisoners in israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the west bank.trump?s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with dan shapiro, the former us ambassador to israel under barack obama, predicting: ?i think the trip?s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that?s going on in washington.? despite the signs posted in jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming trump as ?a friend of zion? and calling on hims to ?make israel great?, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on israel?s right for whom trump?s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration. since his inauguration on 20 january, those same rightwingers fear that trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional us foreign policy position on the peace process.far from moving the us embassy to jerusalem on his first day in office ? as he promised ? trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to israeli settlement building.that has seen david friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new us ambassador to israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure netanyahu?s government that trump remains as firmly committed to israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the us embassy would be made until after trump?s visit.the messaging on the israel-palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one us official telling haaretz on sunday that the height of trump?s ambitions for his ?ultimate deal? right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.?the president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the israeli government takes it into account,? the official said. ?he was also pretty direct with president abbas regarding what they need to do regarding incitement and the payments to families of terrorists. he has been quite clear about that and he will be clear about that during the visit.?instead, the expectation will be that trump will neither outline a vision for a framework for the peace process nor any concrete steps. what noises that have emerged from reported leaks about trump?s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas ? including the idea that israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.on the israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for palestinians on the west bank, including longer opening hours for the allenby bridge crossing to jordan, more building permits in the so-called area c and suggestions for new industrial zones on the west bank.lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini ? and sometimes concocted ? controversies including the comment by a us official telling netanyahu?s office that the western wall was not in israeli territory.trump will, however, become the first us president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by jonathan schanzer of the rightwing us foundation for defence of democracies as a pro-israel step.?i think that if trump himself goes to the western wall and does it with israeli officials, even israeli security, there?s going to be very little argument over who controls it ? certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a jewish holy site,? said schanzer.on the palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding trump on the middle east ? fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric ? have not materialised. ?we?re happy that, contrary to initial expectations, the trump administration has been willing to listen,? one official said. ?our readout is that trump was surprised by abbas?s declaration of his willingness to make peace, having being told the opposite by some of his advisers.?",NEUTRAL,0.5178853273391724

","google has started removing private medical records from its search results, after adjusting its policy regarding personal information.the change was made on thursday to include the ?confidential, personal medical records of private people? in the bracket of information google may remove unprompted from search results. other examples of such information include national or government issued identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and images of signatures.the leaking of private medical records can be extremely damaging to the victims, both financially and emotionally, with future prospects affected and private lives of the vulnerable exposed. given that google?s indexing system will capture anything that?s publicly accessible on the internet, leaks such as those created by an indian pathology lab which uploaded more than 43,000 patient records in december, including names and hiv blood test results, can be particularly damaging.the last change to the removal policy was made in 2015 with the addition of ?nude or sexually explicit images that were uploaded or shared without your consent? to cover so-called revenge porn.the new addition to google?s scrubbing policy marks a change from the search company?s traditional hands-off, algorithmic approach which resists attempts at censorship. this has come under scrutiny over the last few years due to the spread of fake news and misinformation. google recently adjusted its search results to down-rank contested information such as fake news.for many google has become the gateway to the internet, meaning that removal from the company?s search results effectively scrubs them from the internet. while the information will still be accessible via other search engines or directly, other associated actions including the european right to be forgotten have seen being removed from google?s search results as good enough to affect change.google has recently come under fire for its search and services such as youtube being used to spread extremist content, as well as its ad network being used to fund sites dedicated to spreading hate speech and propaganda. the company introduced new measures for youtube to tackle the spread of terrorist material, while its head of european operations apologised after adverts for major brands appeared next to extremist material.",NEUTRAL,0.7145413160324097
Ankush Verma,23 Jul 2017,england to allow gay men to give blood 3 months after sex,www.theguardian.com,"gay men in england will be allowed to donate blood three months after having sex instead of a year, under equalities reforms announced by the government. the reforms will come into force in early 2018. notably, a lifetime ban had been imposed on gay and bisexual men donating blood across the uk during the 1980s aids crisis.","blood donation restrictions for gay men and sex workers are to be relaxed in england and scotland under a series of equalities reforms announced by the government. gay men will be allowed to donate blood three months after sexual intercourse instead of a year. sex workers, who were previously banned from donating, will be subject to the same three-month rule.advances in testing for blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis b and c and hiv, prompted the advisory committee on the safety of blood, tissues and organs to recommend the reforms to the government, which ministers accepted.fears over infections being passed on through donations from gay men led to an outright ban at the height of the aids epidemic, but that was cut to 12 months in 2011. the rule changes on blood donations will be implemented from november in scotland, and early 2018 in england.transgender people will also be able to choose their legal sex more easily as part of the equalities reforms announced by justine greening. ?this government is committed to building an inclusive society that works for everyone, no matter what their gender or sexuality, and today we?re taking the next step forward,? the education and equalities secretary said.?we will build on the significant progress we have made over the past 50 years, tackling some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving lgbt people a real say on the issues affecting them.?reforms making it easier for transgender people to chose their sex legally, by removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn.greening said she wanted to reduce the stigma faced by trans people, who have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to change their gender legally.theresa may indicated earlier this week that she was preparing to reform the gender recognition act, saying: ?when it comes to rights and protections for trans people, there is still a long way to go.?the reforms have been widely welcomed by lgbt campaigners. ethan spibey, founder of freedomtodonate, which campaigns against blood donation restrictions for gay and bisexual men, said: ?today?s announcement from the government marks a world-leading blood donation policy for gay and bisexual men and the other groups previously restricted. i?m so proud that the work of freedomtodonate and our supporters will help ensure more people than ever before are allowed to safely donate blood.?i began this campaign because i wanted to repay the donor who saved my granddad?s life after a major operation, and this announcement means i?m closer than ever to doing that, with the invaluable help of our team of volunteers, and the charities and organisations freedomtodonate represents.?suzanna hopwood, a member of the stonewall trans advisory group, said: ?reform is one of the key priorities in our vision for removing the huge inequalities that trans people face in the uk. the current system is demeaning and broken. it?s vital that this reform removes the requirements for medical evidence and an intrusive interview panel, and finally allows all trans people to have their gender legally recognised through a simple administrative process. that?s what we?ll be calling for during this consultation, and i?m looking forward to seeing the law change soon after.?",NEUTRAL,0.588519811630249

Pragya Swastik,22 May 2017,leak reveals how facebook deals with controversial content,www.theguardian.com,"over 100 documents obtained by the guardian reveal how facebook tackles controversial content like sex, revenge porn, violence, death videos and abuse on its platform. while remarks like ""someone shoot trump"" are deleted, the remark ""let's beat up fat kids"" is allowed. facebook allows livestream of self-harm attempts because it ""doesn't want to censor people in distress,"" the documents said.","facebook?s secret rules and guidelines for deciding what its 2 billion users can post on the site are revealed for the first time in a guardian investigation that will fuel the global debate about the role and ethics of the social media giant.the guardian has seen more than 100 internal training manuals, spreadsheets and flowcharts that give unprecedented insight into the blueprints facebook has used to moderate issues such as violence, hate speech, terrorism, pornography, racism and self-harm.there are even guidelines on match-fixing and cannibalism.the facebook files give the first view of the codes and rules formulated by the site, which is under huge political pressure in europe and the us.they illustrate difficulties faced by executives scrabbling to react to new challenges such as ?revenge porn? ? and the challenges for moderators, who say they are overwhelmed by the volume of work, which means they often have ?just 10 seconds? to make a decision.?facebook cannot keep control of its content,? said one source. ?it has grown too big, too quickly.?many moderators are said to have concerns about the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies. those on sexual content, for example, are said to be the most complex and confusing.one document says facebook reviews more than 6.5m reports a week relating to potentially fake accounts ? known as fnrp (fake, not real person).using thousands of slides and pictures, facebook sets out guidelines that may worry critics who say the service is now a publisher and must do more to remove hateful, hurtful and violent content.yet these blueprints may also alarm free speech advocates concerned about facebook?s de facto role as the world?s largest censor. both sides are likely to demand greater transparency.the guardian has seen documents supplied to facebook moderators within the last year. the files tell them:other types of remarks that can be permitted by the documents include: ?little girl needs to keep to herself before daddy breaks her face,? and ?i hope someone kills you.? the threats are regarded as either generic or not credible.in one of the leaked documents, facebook acknowledges ?people use violent language to express frustration online? and feel ?safe to do so? on the site.it says: ?they feel that the issue won?t come back to them and they feel indifferent towards the person they are making the threats about because of the lack of empathy created by communication via devices as opposed to face to face.?we should say that violent language is most often not credible until specificity of language gives us a reasonable ground to accept that there is no longer simply an expression of emotion but a transition to a plot or design. from this perspective language such as ?i?m going to kill you? or ?fuck off and die? is not credible and is a violent expression of dislike and frustration.?it adds: ?people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in generally facetious and unserious ways.?facebook conceded that ?not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our community standards?.monika bickert, ?facebook?s head of global policy management, said the service had almost 2 billion users and that it was difficult to reach a consensus on what to allow.?we have a really diverse global community and people are going to have very different ideas about what is ok to share. no matter where you draw the line there are always going to be some grey areas. for instance, the line between satire and humour and inappropriate content is sometimes very grey. it is very difficult to decide whether some things belong on the site or not,? she said.?we feel responsible to our community to keep them safe and we feel very accountable. it?s absolutely our responsibility to keep on top of it. it?s a company commitment. we will continue to invest in proactively keeping the site safe, but we also want to empower people to report to us any content that breaches our standards.?she said some offensive comments may violate facebook policies in some contexts, but not in others.  facebook?s leaked policies on subjects including violent death, images of non-sexual physical child abuse and animal cruelty show how the site tries to navigate a minefield.the files say: ?videos of violent deaths are disturbing but can help create awareness. for videos, we think minors need protection and adults need a choice. we mark as ?disturbing? videos of the violent deaths of humans.?such footage should be ?hidden from minors? but not automatically deleted because it can ?be valuable in creating awareness for self-harm afflictions and mental illness or war crimes and other important issues?.regarding non-sexual child abuse, facebook says: ?we do not action photos of child abuse. we mark as disturbing videos of child abuse. we remove imagery of child abuse if shared with sadism and celebration.?one slide explains facebook does not automatically delete evidence of non-sexual child abuse to allow the material to be shared so ?the child [can] be identified and rescued, but we add protections to shield the audience?. this might be a warning on the video that the content is disturbing.facebook confirmed there are ?some situations where we do allow images of non-sexual abuse of a child for the purpose of helping the child?.its policies on animal abuse are also explained, with one slide saying: ?we allow photos and videos documenting animal abuse for awareness, but may add viewer protections to some content that is perceived as extremely disturbing by the audience.?generally, imagery of animal abuse can be shared on the site. some extremely disturbing imagery may be marked as disturbing.? photos of animal mutilation, including those showing torture, can be marked as disturbing rather than deleted. moderators can also leave photos of abuse where a human kicks or beats an animal. facebook said: ?we allow people to share images of animal abuse to raise awareness and condemn the abuse but remove content that celebrates cruelty against animals.?the files show facebook has issued new guidelines on nudity after last year?s outcry when it removed an iconic vietnam war photo because the girl in the picture was naked.it now allows for ?newsworthy exceptions? under its ?terror of war? guidelines but draws the line at images of ?child nudity in the context of the holocaust?. facebook told the guardian it was using software to intercept some graphic content before it got on the site, but that ?we want people to be able to discuss global and current events ? so the context in which a violent image is shared sometimes matters?.some critics in the us and europe have demanded that the company be regulated in the same way as mainstream broadcasters and publishers.but bickert said facebook was ?a new kind of company. it?s not a traditional technology company. it?s not a traditional media company. we build technology, and we feel responsible for how it?s used. we don?t write the news that people read on the platform.?a report by british mps published on 1 may said ?the biggest and richest social media companies are shamefully far from taking sufficient action to tackle illegal or dangerous content, to implement proper community standards or to keep their users safe?.sarah t roberts, an expert on content moderation, said: ?it?s one thing when you?re a small online community with a group of people who share principles and values, but when you have a large percentage of the world?s population and say ?share yourself?, you are going to be in quite a muddle. ?then when you monetise that practice you are entering a disaster situation.?facebook has consistently struggled to assess the news or ?awareness? value of violent imagery. while the company recently faced harsh criticism for failing to remove videos of robert godwin being killed in the us and of a father killing his child in thailand, the platform has also played an important role in disseminating videos of police killings and other government abuses.in 2016, facebook removed a video showing the immediate aftermath of the fatal police shooting of philando castile but subsequently reinstated the footage, saying the deletion was a ?mistake?.

tillerson told the independent journal review (ijr), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation asia trip. ?my wife told me i?m supposed to do this.?he said he had not met donald trump before being summoned to trump tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company ceo.?when he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, i was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at exxonmobil, he had expected to retire: ?i was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?however, he said that when he returned to his texas home after meeting trump in new york, his wife, renda st clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?i told you god?s not through with you.?he said he now feels his wife had been right: ?i?m supposed to do this.?not everyone shares that view. tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of february. he was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of muslim countries.he has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. he did not take the washington diplomatic press corps with him on his asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. the sole exception was the journalist from the ijr, a little-known outlet founded by a former republican operative. the initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. in his interview, tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.he told the ijr: ?i?m not a big media press access person. i personally don?t need it. i understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but i also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?when questioned about russia, the ijr reported: ?he was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. senior republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the white house would not pass congress. in his remarks to the ijr, however, tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the us diplomatic establishment.?looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. he said he had not yet talked to trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?we haven?t gotten that far yet.?while in south korea, tillerson was reported in the seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. in response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?they never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because i was tired,? he told the ijr. on tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged tillerson would skip what would have been his first nato foreign ministers? meeting in early april in brussels so he could be in florida for trump?s first meeting with the chinese president, xi jinping. the state department spokesman, mark toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to nato and that tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-isis meeting in washington on wednesday. toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible nato meeting.",SUBJECTIVE,0.7418463230133057

","interpol has circulated a list of 173 islamic state fighters it believes could have been trained to mount suicide attacks in europe in revenge for the group?s military defeats in the middle east.the global crime fighting agency?s list was drawn up by us intelligence from information captured during the assault on isis territories in syria and iraq.european counter-terror networks are concerned that as the isis ?caliphate? collapses, there is an increasing risk of determined suicide bombers seeking to come to europe, probably operating alone.there is no evidence that any of the people on the list, whose names the guardian has obtained, have yet entered europe, but the interpol circulation, designed to see if eu intelligence sources have any details on the individuals, underlines the scale of the challenge facing europe.the list, sent out by the general secretariat of interpol on 27 may, defines the group of fighters as individuals that ?may have been trained to build and position improvised explosive devices in order to cause serious deaths and injuries. it is believed that they can travel internationally, to participate in terrorist activities.?the data was originally collected by the us intelligence ?through trusted channels?. the material was handed over to the fbi, which transmitted the list to interpol for global sharing.a note appended to the interpol list circulated in italy explains how the terrorist database was constructed, putting together the pieces of the puzzle from hundreds of elements, mainly gathered when isis local headquarters were captured.?the people,? the note says, ?have been identified through materials found in the hiding places of isil, the islamic state of iraq and the levant.? the note adds that ?it emerges that those subjects may have manifested willingness to commit a suicidal attack or martyrdom to support islam?.the list shows the suspects? names, the date isis recruited them, their last likely address including the mosque at which they have been praying while away fighting, their mother?s name and any photographs.for each of the fighters, an id was created to ensure that each member country in the interpol network could integrate the data with local databases.interpol has asked its national partners for any information they might have about each name on the list, and any other background personal data they have on their files, such as border crossings, previous criminal offences, biometric data, passport numbers, activity on social media and travel history.the information will then be included in interpol?s asf (automatic search facility) database in order to possibly put the names on a higher level watch list.us intelligence is apparently confident about the reliability of the sources used to compile the list. but western counter-terrorism forces have said they face an uphill struggle identifying potential suspects, who have access to a mountain of false documents, double identities and fake passports.interpol stressed the list?s transmission came as part of its role circulating information between national crime-fighting agencies. ?interpol regularly sends alerts and updates to its national central bureaux (ncb) on wanted terrorists and criminals via our secure global police communications network,? a spokesman said. ?it is the member country which provides the information that decides which other countries it can be shared with.?the purpose of sending these alerts and updates is to ensure that vital policing information is made available when and where it is needed, in line with a member country?s request.?a european counter-terrorism officer said one of the purposes of circulating the list around europe was to identify those on it who might have been born and raised in european countries. in 2015 the un considered there were 20,000 foreign fighters in iraq and syria, of whom 4,000 were from europe, but there has not previously been a specific list of those fighters including those born in the middle east who have been identified as potential suicide bombers.the speed with which isis fighters are likely to attempt to reach europe will depend on a range of issues including whether the group tries to set up a new base in syria in the wake of the impending fall of raqqa, its last major redoubt in north-west syria. there is a growing suggestion that isis fighters will shift south from raqqa to the defensible territory stretching from deir el-zourez-zor to abu kamal.the jihadi group is currently struggling to come to terms with the loss of mosul in northern iraq following a battle that produced some of the most brutal fighting since the end of the second world war. the parallel advance on raqqa, the group?s other urban stronghold in the region, has been stalled partly due to the severity of the resistance being mounted against the syrian democratic forces made up of an alliance of kurds, arabs and us special forces. us army col ryan dillon on friday estimated there were around 2,000 isis militants in the city, who he said were using civilians and children as human shields. the distance between sdf forces on the eastern side of the city and on the western fronts is now just under 2km. the united nations estimates that about 190,000 residents of raqqa province have been displaced since april, including about 20,000 since the operation to seize the provincial capital began in early june.us diplomats this week admitted that the sdf forces, due to their ethnic make-up, will be constrained from going south of raqqa to pursue isis as far as deir azzour, saying this may be the task of the syrian forces under bashar al assad, or even iranian-backed shia militia.",NEUTRAL,0.6816378235816956

here?s the text of trump?s inauguration speech, as prepared for delivery:chief justice roberts, president carter, president clinton, president bush, president obama, fellow americans, and people of the world: thank you.we, the citizens of america, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.together, we will determine the course of america and the world for years to come.we will face challenges. we will confront hardships. but we will get the job done.every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. they have been magnificent.today?s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another ? but we are transferring power from washington, d.c. and giving it back to you, the american people.for too long, a small group in our nation?s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.washington flourished ? but the people did not share in its wealth.politicians prospered ? but the jobs left, and the factories closed.the establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation?s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.that all changes ? starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america. this is your day. this is your celebration.and this, the united states of america, is your country.what truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.january 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.everyone is listening to you now.you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.but for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.this american carnage stops right here and stops right now.we are one nation ? and their pain is our pain. their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. we share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans.for many decades, we?ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry;subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;we?ve defended other nation?s borders while refusing to defend our own;and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america?s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.we?ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.one by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind.the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.but that is the past. and now we are looking only to the future.we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.from this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.from this moment on, it?s going to be america first.every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit american workers and american families.we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.i will fight for you with every breath in my body ? and i will never, ever let you down.america will start winning again, winning like never before.we will bring back our jobs. we will bring back our borders. we will bring back our wealth. and we will bring back our dreams.we will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.we will get our people off of welfare and back to work ? rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor.we will follow two simple rules: buy american and hire american.we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world ? but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones ? and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.the bible tells us, ?how good and pleasant it is when god?s people live together in unity.?we must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.when america is united, america is totally unstoppable.there should be no fear ? we are protected, and we will always be protected.we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by god.finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.in america, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ? constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.the time for empty talk is over.now arrives the hour of action.do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america.we will not fail. our country will thrive and prosper again.we stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.a new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.it is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great american flag.and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.so to all americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:you will never be ignored again.your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our american destiny. and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.together, we will make america strong again.we will make america wealthy again.we will make america proud again.we will make america safe again.and, yes, together, we will make america great again. thank you, god bless you, and god bless america.

Gaurav Shroff,20 May 2017,'doomsday' vault flooded after surrounding soil melts,www.theguardian.com,"norway's global seed vault, meant to preserve world's crops from ""doomsday"" scenarios like nuclear war or asteroid strike has been flooded. the vault, built in permafrost (permanently frozen soil), was breached after soaring temperatures in the arctic post earth's hottest recorded year sent water gushing into its entrance. however, no damage was done to the seeds, said a government official.","it was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world?s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity?s food supply forever. but the global seed vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.the vault is on the norwegian island of spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. when it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide ?failsafe? protection against ?the challenge of natural or man-made disasters?.but soaring temperatures in the arctic at the end of the world?s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. ?it was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,? said hege njaa aschim, from the norwegian government, which owns the vault.?a lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,? she told the guardian. fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18c.but the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. ?it was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,? aschim said. ?we must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.?the vault?s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. the end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7c above normal on spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point.?the question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?? said aschim. the svalbard archipelago, of which spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to ketil isaksen, from norway?s meteorological institute. ?the arctic and especially svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. the climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,? isaksen told the norwegian newspaper dagbladet.the vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. they have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood.aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: ?we have to find solutions. it is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. we are doing this for the world.??this is supposed to last for eternity,? said Åsmund asdal at the nordic genetic resource centre, which operates the seed vault.",SUBJECTIVE,0.5003656148910522

Vani Vivek,20 Jun 2017,you've to be willing to disrupt yourself: instagram founder,www.theguardian.com,"instagram co-founder mike krieger revealed that the one thing he would've done differently was realising that founders have to ""be willing to disrupt"" themselves and get comfortable with making changes to their product. krieger added he would have hired people faster as they lost ""so much sleep in the early days...it took a toll on our health and, probably, relationships.""","we [kevin systrom and mike krieger] both went to stanford and at that point we knew we wanted to do something entrepreneurial. i hadn?t had that idea before coming to california but you?re surrounded by so many people there that have an entrepreneurial venture. it?s in the water, it?s in the air, and it?s very inspiring. i think kevin was interested in entrepreneurship from an even earlier age. he was one of those high schoolers doing odds and ends to try to make a company.when we reconnected after university, we were both interested in building products that help people connect and tell their story, although we didn?t know what our product would be. we both quit our jobs because we knew we wanted to pursue something; it took about nine months until we found out what that thing actually was. we just get on really well, it?s seven years into the business and we?re still very close. we?re good friends, but we?re not best friends. i think if we were best friends it would be messier because we?ve spent so much time with each other [on the business]. also, we balance each other out, there are times when i?m very stressed and he?s very calm, and vice versa. we can be each other?s therapists at some points.we also have very complementary skills. i bring a lot of the technology and engineering side; he brings a lot of product sense and design. he was also great at working with investors and today he is great at working across the different departments at facebook [instagram was sold to facebook in 2012 for $1bn]. i like to go focus on the technology side a bit more. it works because we don?t want each other?s jobs. for us, one of the key things was being able to demonstrate, if not global traction, at least initial interest. we?d built this product called burbn, which was the predecessor to instagram [burbn was a location check-in app that also allowed users to share photos, which proved to be its most popular feature]. i think the way we were able to raise financing on that product [burbn secured $500,000 in seed funding] is that we had a couple of hundred people using it and some were really passionate about it, those user stories were really key.investors have a mental check list of all the different risks a product might face: founder risk (are they the right founders?), execution risk, market risk. you need to remove some of those impediments from investors minds as early as possible by getting a product out there. from doing that you learn and you are able to say: ?look, this isn?t just a hope and a dream, this is something we?ve already put out to a couple of hundred people.? i think that made a lot of difference in raising financing.there have been a couple ... even in the last year and a half you?ve seen our product go through a major evolution. it sounds like a silly example, but going from square to non-square photos was actually a big deal. then we changed the feed, and then added stories [an instagram feature that launched in 2016, which allows a user to give an overview of their day, or an event, by pulling together videos and photos into a short clip].sometimes the most resistance [to changing the product] comes from your own staff. it?s not because they?re conservative, but because change is scary ? it feels like driving a car that could go off a cliff. that?s where instagram still being founder-led makes a big difference. we can say: ?just take the leap of faith with us. we?re going to make this change and, if we?re wrong, we can roll it back.? there are few decisions you could make that could totally tank the company. we?ve learned that when the decision feels really hard it doesn?t necessarily mean it?s the right one, but it means we?re taking the right kind of risk.there was so much lost sleep in the early days and it took a toll on our healthi think the ability to make things is super important. i?ve met a fair amount of people who have an incredible idea for an app, and that?s great, but it?s even better when paired with the ability to prototype it. today there are lots of resources around for building apps. acquire those skills as early as possible, and develop them.once we got to facebook we had to enter a growth phase from being a 13-person company to a team of hundreds. every six months we have a big meeting where we get everybody together to talk about the next six months. i remember one meeting where we screened a video showing the impact instagram was having across the world. i looked around and everybody was so proud to have created that and to work on it, that was really special. at some point you have to be ready to let go of being the one person working on a business. the fact that we?ve been able to make that transition means a lot. firstly, create a business profile. with that entrepreneurs are able to access analytics and insights about their audience [such as what time of the day they are using instagram]. we?ve learned the value of data to instagram, so we want to bring that to other people. secondly, entrepreneurs should use a variety of different instagram tools to tell their story, using their instagram feed, but also experimenting with stories and even posting live. they can use this to bring their audience along with them and let them view their business a new way, whether that?s behind the scenes or to an event. i would have hired much faster. there was so much lost sleep in the early days and it took a toll on our health and, probably, our relationships. it also took us a while to get comfortable with making big changes to the product. you have to be willing to disrupt yourself.mike krieger spoke at the instagram #wemadeit entrepreneurs breakfast.sign up to become a member of the guardian small business network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.",SUBJECTIVE,0.9309976100921631

until the double transplant changed his life. ?at 18 months [after the transplant], the child had exceeded his previous adaptive abilities. as of 18 months after transplantation surgery he is able to write and feed, toilet and dress himself more independently and efficiently than he could do before transplantation,? writes the team from the children?s hospital of philadelphia in the lancet child and adolescent health.organ transplantation is risky in that a recipient?s body may reject the new body part, while the drug regime involved carries a series of health risks. two years on from the surgery he had in july 2015, zion, now 10, is coping well with both. ?cases like this demonstrate how new developments and innovation in science and transplantation have the potential to make enormous differences to the quality of life of patients,? said lorna marson, the president of the british transplantation society, which represents specialists working in the field across the nhs. ?transplantation is a constantly evolving sector and it is heartening to hear the positive outcomes of groundbreaking transplants such as this one.?more than 100 people worldwide have had a hand or arm transplant since the first adult received a new hand in 1998, closely followed by the first replacement of both hands in 2000. many countries now conduct such transplants on small numbers of carefully selected patients. in may 2000, a baby girl in malaysia who was born with a severe congenital deformity became the first child to receive a new hand and arm, transplanted from her identical twin sister who died at birth. in an update last year on his progress in the year since his surgery, zion said: ?the only thing that?s different is instead of no hands, i have two hands. i?m still the same kid everybody knew without hands.? referring to his new hands, he added: ?here?s the piece of my life that was missing. now it?s here, my life is complete.? within eight months of the operation zion was using scissors and crayons and after a year he was able to swing a baseball bat with both hands ? once throwing the opening pitch at a baltimore orioles game. dr scott levin, team leader for zion?s 10-hour surgery, has praised his young patient?s bravery. ?i?ve never seen zion cry. i?ve never seen him not want to do his therapy. he?s just such a remarkable human being, let alone child or adult. he has such courage and determination and gives us all inspiration,? he said.but the last two years have been mentally and physically hard for zion. he has had huge amounts of physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help him adjust, as well as counselling to aid his psychological recovery. the doctors write: ?since his surgery he has undergone eight rejections of the hands, including serious episodes during the fourth and seventh months of his transplant. all of these were reversed with immunosuppression drugs without impacting the function of the child?s hands.?

Ankush Verma,20 Jul 2017,trump orders republicans to 'let obamacare fail',www.theguardian.com,"after efforts to repeal and replace barack obama's affordable care act collapsed, us president donald trump has said that republicans should ""let obamacare fail"". ""i think we're probably in that position where we'll let obamacare fail. we're not going to own it. i'm not going to own it,"" trump added. notably, around 2 crore people gained health coverage under obamacare.","donald trump said republicans should ?let obamacare fail?, after the dramatic collapse of efforts to repeal and replace barack obama?s affordable care act (aca).the president spoke as a new plan to simply repeal the 2010 law with no replacement was in effect strangled at birth by a deeply divided party. this followed the withdrawal of legislation, blindsiding the president, on monday night.venting his frustration, trump said: ?let obamacare fail and it will be a lot easier. and i think we?re probably in that position where we?ll let obamacare fail. we?re not going to own it. i?m not going to own it. i can tell you the republicans are not going to own it. we?ll let obamacare fail and then the democrats are going to come to us.?trump made the repeal and replacement of the aca a central promise of his election campaign. republicans, driven by ideological zeal, have spent seven years vowing to wipe out obama?s signature legislative achievement. but they have been far less clear about their alternative.their failure means that trump will mark six months in office on thursday without a major legislative achievement, despite republicans controlling the white house, senate and house of representatives.the president received a chastening lesson about the limit of his power on monday night as he hosted senators for a white house dinner, reportedly of steak and succotash. even as he warned guests of the dire consequences of failing to kill the aca while they control the both chambers of congress, two senators who were not invited were preparing statements that would essentially grant it a stay of execution.mike lee of utah and jerry moran of kansas took the white house by surprise. the pair joined susan collins of maine and rand paul of kentucky in opposing the bill.the defections left the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, without enough votes to pass the bill. mcconnell conceded in a statement at 10.47pm: ?regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of obamacare will not be successful.?mcconnell on tuesday vowed to bring repeal legislation to the senate floor in the coming days, but this also fell apart when on tuesday three republicans ? collins, shelley moore capito of west virginia and lisa murkowski of alaska ? came out against it, amid worries that repealing the healthcare law without a replacement would cause turmoil in insurance markets. ?i want this game plan explained to me,? ron johnson, a conservative senator from wisconsin, told reporters on capitol hill, refusing to say if he still had faith in mcconnell.in a floor speech on tuesday evening, mcconnell said that he would hold a vote to open debate on a measure to repeal the aca ?early next week?, even though it is expected to fail. the decision to press ahead with a vote next week was made after consultation with his conference as well as a discussion with the president and vice-president, mcconnell said. during an earlier press conference, the kentucky republican brushed aside criticism of his leadership and the process, saying: ?this has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us.?mcconnell?s democratic counterpart, the minority leader, chuck schumer, said democrats remained prepared to work with republicans on improving the healthcare law ?rather than sabotaging it?.obama spent huge amounts of political capital to get the law passed in 2010. about 20 million people have gained coverage. republicans were vehemently opposed from day one. they won the house in 2010, the senate in 2014. a year later, the senate voted to repeal obamacare ? but it was inevitably vetoed by obama. the house has voted more than 60 times to repeal or alter the aca, but most of those votes were also merely symbolic.on tuesday, the arkansas senator tom cotton told the conservative radio host hugh hewitt: ?i don?t see how any republican senator who voted just 18 months ago for this very piece of legislation could now flip-flop 18 months on with obamacare still inflicting so much harm on americans, and the fact that we campaigned on this for four straight elections.?as recently as january, however, cotton himself warned against repealing the healthcare law without a replacement.trump?s arrival on the scene upended the party. he stuck to the ?repeal and replace? mantra during the election campaign, but he also promised to protect medicaid, the government programme that supports the poor, the vulnerable and the elderly. after winning the election, he told a press conference in january: ?it will be repeal and replace. it will be essentially simultaneously.?it will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day. could be the same hour. so we?re going to do repeal and replace. very complicated stuff.?but by february, as reality set in, his tone changed. ?nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated,? he said.some house republicans praised trump for lobbying them in person and by phone, though others questioned how much he understood about the bill. after their first attempt ended in ignominy, they narrowly passed a bill and celebrated with trump in the rose garden at the white house. critics saw that as a moment of hubris. weeks later, trump privately described the house bill as ?mean?, reportedly infuriating many of the members.then came wrangling the senate, where republicans? 52-48 majority leaves little room for error. hopes rested on the shoulders of the wily mcconnell. just as in the house, the first package last month lacked enough support and was withdrawn.then, last weekend, 80-year-old senator john mccain of arizona had surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye and remained in his home state to recover. this accident of history meant momentum was lost.the republican effort has been hobbled by a split between moderates concerned about medicaid cuts and conservatives who want more radical changes. the party has also faced the stark, politically unpalatable possibility that the aca is a genie that cannot be wished back into the bottle.mcconnell?s failed bill would have left 22 million uninsured by 2026, according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office (cbo), an estimate that many republicans found toxic and feared put them at risk of a political backlash.some republican and democratic state governors, who help oversee the joint federal-state medicaid programme as well as private health insurers, have resisted efforts to unravel the aca, which expanded medicaid in some states and cut the number of uninsured citizens. congressional democrats have remained united in opposition.?the core of this bill is unworkable,? schumer said, adding that republicans ?should start from scratch and work with democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our healthcare system?.some republicans signalled on tuesday a willingness to team up with democrats to stabilise the marketplace as a temporary fix. but john cornyn of texas, the senate republican whip, poured cold water on the idea, telling reporters he opposed any ?bailout? of insurance companies.there are, however, two possible consolations for trump from the latest setback. projections by the cbo and others suggest that the republican bill would have hit his own supporters the hardest, in states such as west virginia. paradoxically, doing nothing may be better for his base.secondly, he is already returning to themes of his anti-establishment election campaign, blaming washington politicians from both parties for the deadlock. mike pence said on capitol hill: ?the senate should vote to repeal now and replace later, or return to the legislation carefully crafted in the house and senate. but either way, inaction is not an option. congress needs to step up. congress needs to do their job and congress needs to do their job now.? republicans vented frustration with colleagues who had previously supported a measure to repeal the healthcare law when obama wielded the veto power, but were now reluctant to do so. ?everybody?s frustrated ? a lot of us are ? that we have got a few people running on this when they shouldn?t,? said richard shelby, a reliably conservative senator from alabama, referring to republicans? seven years of promises to repeal the aca.

Deepali Aggarwal,19 Apr 2017,book reveals clinton congratulated trump after election,www.theguardian.com,"according to the book titled 'shattered: inside hillary clinton's doomed campaign', hillary clinton phoned her presidential election opponent donald trump to say ""congratulations, donald"" after her loss. she added, ""i'll be supportive of the country's success, and your success as president"". clinton also called former president barack obama and apologised to him for the loss, the book revealed.","as the first polls closed on 8 november, hillary clinton was preparing for the moment she would at long last take the stage as the first female president of the united states.she instead found herself apologizing to barack obama hours later in a harrowing phone call, moments after conceding the presidential election to donald trump.?mr president, i?m sorry,? clinton told obama, who had contacted her to extend his condolences for her loss.the phone call is one of several revelations in the new book shattered, in which the journalists jonathan allen and amie parnes chronicle clinton?s 18-month quest to do what eluded her in 2008 and break ?that highest, hardest glass ceiling?.the book sheds particular light on the painful turn of events on election night, as clinton watched the returns deviate dramatically from the path her campaign had so confidently predicted. surrounded by family and aides at the peninsula hotel in manhattan, she saw the first cracks emerge as the must-win state of florida turned dicey. steve schale, among the most reliable democratic strategists in the state, informed clinton?s campaign they were short on votes.as other battlegrounds began to crumble, a sober mood took hold in the suite. but soon, the authors wrote, aides began to blame each other as bill clinton grew increasingly upset and hillary clinton became withdrawn.it was obama, taking in the results with his own advisers in washington, who broke up the slumber with a series of phone calls from the white house. wisconsin, a democratic stronghold, had just been called for trump. some states remained excruciatingly close, but the president was convinced of the outcome and did not want to question the legitimacy of the election as trump had done just weeks earlier while facing off against clinton in the debates.?you need to concede,? obama told clinton after his political director had failed to persuade clinton?s campaign manager, robby mook, on the point.it took one more phone call from the president ? to clinton?s campaign chairman, john podesta ? before she asked her close aide huma abedin for the phone and uttered the words she never thought she would say: ?congratulations, donald. ?i?ll be supportive of the country?s success, and that means your success as president,? clinton said.it was after her brief conversation with trump that clinton apologized to obama.the book is the second collaboration for allen and parnes, who in 2014 authored hrc, a detailed account of clinton?s tenure at the helm of the state department, in anticipation of her second presidential run. as the first take on clinton?s doomed campaign, they offer a behind-the-scenes view of the obstacles in her way ? some familiar and others a consequence of the shifting american electorate. there is the familiar tension between the old guard that has for decades operated ?clintonworld? and the new blood that labored in brooklyn to reinvent the campaign of one of the most well-known public figures in the world. the authors revisit the unexpected challenge from bernie sanders, whose insurgent campaign captured the wave of economic populism sweeping the country. the infighting amid the democratic primaries, as team clinton struggled to decisively put away the senator, is a dominant theme of the book?s first half.and then there are the emails.the aftermath of clinton?s decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, and subsequent discord among her inner circle over how to respond, is retold with the benefit of hindsight. we learn that bill clinton did not believe she should apologize, as neither he nor she felt there had been any wrongdoing.clinton eventually did apologize to the public in august 2015, six months after the server issue was first brought to light.the role of russian interference in the us election, now the subject of three investigations in washington, is barely explored in the book, although the authors do say that clinton?s former aides see it as one of the main reasons for her loss.the effects of trump?s nationalist campaign are also relegated to the backseat, as this is a story primarily told through how clinton?s campaign adapted (or sometimes crucially didn?t) to the evolving political climate. staffers were confident in their sophisticated voter modeling and analytics, and fatally failed to spot when they veered off target.clinton, for her part, carried a lingering doubt throughout the campaign. ?why aren?t they with me?? she asked of working class white people during the democratic primaries. ?why can?t we bring them onboard??it was a question her campaign never quite answered.",NEUTRAL,0.6078376770019531

said lord justice kitchin.the ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between nestlé and mondel?z, the us owner of cadbury, that have been battling over the kitkat trademark for seven years.nestle?s appeal followed a uk high court ruling in january last year that blocked the trademark attempt. the european court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with european law.the ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat kitkats without fear of legal consequences.but a nestlé spokesperson indicated the swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. the company could potentially try to take the case to the uk supreme court.?nestlé is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,? said the spokesperson. ?kitkat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. nestlé?s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance germany, france, australia, south africa and canada, further protecting it from imitations.?following the appeal ruling, a mondel?z spokesperson said: ?as we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the kitkat bar should be protected as a trademark in the uk.?the case turned on whether a the product?s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format. protected ?shape marks? are not without precedent ? toblerone, which is owned by mondel?z, has successfully trademarked its ?zigzag prism? shape.but the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be ?very well known? in association with kitkat, ?that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.?they might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.?these kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.?the judges also noted that the chocolate bar?s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: ?it has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.?the judges heard that nestlé had spent between £3m and £11m a year advertising and promoting kitkats between 1996 and 2007. more than 40m were sold in britain in 2010.?the appeal court?s ruling indicates that shape marks are going to be increasingly difficult to obtain,? said guy wilmot, partner who specialises in intellectual property law at russell-cooke.?the court were ... concerned that if they granted the trade mark, nestlé would have a potentially permanent monopoly on the four-finger shape, which they felt would be unfair given that kitkat had never used the shape alone to promote kitkats.?clare jackman, an intellectual property lawyer at norton rose fulbright, said the fact the two multinationals were prepared to battle through the courts for so long showed the value of what was at stake. ?trademarks are very important and valuable business assets. they confer monopoly rights, so i can see entirely why nestlé thought, ?our four-finger bar kitkat has been around for ages, let?s register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers??, she said.?it is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.?asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, jackman said: ?i?m not going to rule it out, because i think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.?the four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners. in 2004, cadbury attempted to trademark the shade of purple it uses for its dairy milk bars, registering pantone 2685c in a move that was initially successful before the court of appeal backed nestlé challenge in 2013. an attempt last year by cadbury to resurrect an earlier trademark on the colour was rejected by the high court.the first kitkat-type bar was sold in britain by rowntree in 1935, when it was called chocolate crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. nestlé acquired rowntree in 1998.a lookalike called kvikk lunsj, translated as ?quick lunch?, launched in norway in 1937 and is available in some uk shops.?

""our streaming membership grew more than expected, from 99 million to 104 million, due to our amazing content,"" said netflix ceo reed hastings. netflix is currently available in over 190 countries.","the remarkable change in the way the world watches tv has been underlined by new data from netflix showing that more than 100 million people worldwide now subscribe to the streaming service.the company - which is now valued at $78bn (£60bn), making it worth almost nine times as much as the uk?s itv and1.5 times bigger then rupert murdoch?s 21st century fox - added 5.2 milllion subscribers in the second quarter.it was a far bigger number than wall street had expected and this is traditionally netflix?s slowest time of the year: over the past five years it has averaged growth of less than 2 million in the spring months.most of the growth ? more than 4 million of the new users ? came from international subscribers lured by netflix?s combination of new shows such as the crown and stranger things, while stalwarts house of cards and orange is the new black are continuing tofind new audiences.in the past two decades the company has transformed from a california-based mail order dvd outfit to a global digital giant that has transformed the way the public watch tv.the company?s share price climbed almost 10% to $180 a share in after-hours trading in new york on monday, after the new subscriber numbers were revealed. by lunchtime on wall street on tuesday they were up to $183.for founder reed hastings, the continued success of the business the soaring number of subscribers is continued proof that his vision of pick-and-mix tv on demand will replace traditional scheduled tv.?creating a tv network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment is pouring into content production around the world,? he said in a letter to shareholders on monday. ?we are all co-pioneers of internet tv and, together, we are replacing linear tv.?netflix?s binge-watching model, which was at first seen as commercial suicide by most traditional broadcasters, is now aped by rivals. such has been its cultural impact that it even spawned an expression to refer to relaxing and catching a show ? ?netflix and chill? ? although it has since morphed into aeuphemism for sex.growth is now being fuelled by growth outside its home market. the boom in international growth followed the expansion of the service into 130 countries last year. more than 52 million of its 104 million subscribers now come from outside the us and only a handful of countries ? including north korea, china and syria ? do not have the service.netflix doesn?t provide detailed statistics by country, but ampere analysis reckons there are 6.4 million uksubscribers compared with about 5 million for amazon prime video.hastings described the growth as a ?good quarter?

tech and media giants - facebook, amazon, netflix and google ? are valued on wall street at more than $1.5tn. netflix has seen its share price rocket 64% over the past year ? it is worth almost four times as much as sky ? but it still only ranks as the minnow of the group.hastings said the company intends to invest even more in content, even though it is already pouring $6.6bn into making and acquiring tv shows and films this year. currently nearly $16bn is due to be poured into production over the next five years.so far this huge investment has fuelled a netflix hit machine. it has doubled its haul of emmy nominations this year, securing 91 compared with 54 last year, for 27 titles including the crown, stranger things and master of none.only hbo, on which netflix has based its model, fared better, with 111 nominations. hbo spends about $2bn annually on content, and amazon about $4.5bn, according to unofficial analyst estimates.netflix famously refuses to reveal figures on how popular, or not, its shows are. ampere analysis has produced a report looking at the most cost-effective shows on netflix by looking at programme budgets cross-referenced with popularity ratings on imdb, to give a proxy for probable viewing.according to that data the most cost-effective shows for netflix ? or the best value in terms of spend versus viewing ? were 1980s sci-fi drama stranger things, teen suicide drama 13 reasons why, narcos, and marvel series such as jessica jones, daredevil and luke cage. house of cards and orange is the new black also ranked highly.however, the hit machine also has misses. recently, netflix has culled a slew of underperforming shows to better balance viewer interest with climbing programme costs.ampere says the least cost-effective shows are led by the $9m-per-episode marco polo, which was cancelled after two seasons and reportedly resulted in a $200m loss. another was baz luhrmann?s the get down, which had a budget of up to $16m an episode, which was cancelled after one season. other misses have included high-concept sci-fi series sense8, hemlock grove and girlboss.hastings conceded there is furious competition between netflix and other subscription on-demand tv services, from digital rivals such as amazon and hulu to traditional broadcasters such as sky and the bbc. but he insisted his company was not killing their businesses.?it seems our growth just expands the market,?

Deepali Aggarwal,17 Jul 2017,south korea seeks rare military talks with north korea,www.theguardian.com,"south korea has proposed military talks with north korea to ease tensions over the latter's nuclear and ballistic missile programme, for the first time under president moon jae-in. the offer by jae-in, who has vowed to achieve peace with north korea, comes after the reclusive state claimed to have test-fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile.","south korea has offered to hold rare military talks with the north to ease tensions after pyongyang?s first intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this month.monday?s offer, the first since south korea elected the moderate moon jae-in as president, came as the red cross in seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 korean war.the south?s defence ministry proposed a meeting on friday at the border truce village of panmunjom, while the red cross offered to hold talks on 1 august at the same venue.if the government meeting goes ahead, it will be the first official inter-korea talks since december 2015. moon?s conservative predecessor, park geun-hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.the red cross said it hoped for a positive response from its counterpart in the north; mooted family reunions in early october would be the first in two years.millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the peninsula. many died without getting a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the heavily-fortified border, across which all civilian communication is banned. only about 60,000 members of divided families are still left in the south. ?north korea should respond to our sincere proposals if it really seeks peace on the korean peninsula,? said cho myoung-gyon, seoul?s unification minister in charge of north korea affairs.cho stressed that seoul ?would not seek collapse of the north or unification through absorbing the north? and urged pyongyang to restore inter-korea communication channels, including a shuttered military hotline. moon, who took power in may, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed north as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table and vowed to play a more active role in global efforts to tame the south?s unpredictable neighbour.but pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of un resolutions, most recently on 4 july when it test-fired its first icbm, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by the us president, donald trump, to impose harsher un sanctions on the country.washington has also called on china, the north?s sole ally, to put more pressure on pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions, which have advanced rapidly under the north?s leader, kim jong-un. ?we make the proposal for a meeting ? aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,? the defence ministry said in a statement.[new]the european union offered european support for south korean efforts to negotiate with north korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.in a statement monday, the eu?s executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a ?serious threat to international peace and security? and urged an end to such actions.the latest missile test ? which kim described as a ?gift? to the americans ? was seen as a milestone in pyongyang?s quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the us mainland.the proposed meetings, if realised, would be a ?rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for 10 years?, said cheong seong-chang, analyst at the sejong institute, a thinktank.?it would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the north would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes,? he said. the agenda for the meeting could include moves to suspend propaganda campaigns operated on both sides of the border for years, cheong added. the south?s military has deployed dozens of giant loudspeakers along the tense border to blare out a mix of world news, k-pop songs and other propaganda targeting young north korean soldiers. it has also occasionally launched giant balloons containing anti-pyongyang leaflets across the border despite warnings of military retaliation by the north.the north has responded with its own propaganda broadcasts and sent anti-seoul leaflets via giant balloons across the border.

Deepali Aggarwal,17 Jul 2017,trump's approval rating lowest among us presidents in 70 yrs,www.theguardian.com,"donald trump's six-month approval rating stands at 36%, the lowest among all us presidents in the last 70 years, according to a national poll published on sunday. the poll found that 48% of us citizens believe that the country's leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office. however, trump called the poll result ""not bad"".","donald trump?s approval rating has plunged in a national poll, published on sunday, that charts americans? perceptions of a stalling domestic policy agenda and declining leadership on the world stage. the washington post/abc news poll, which put trump?s six-month approval rating at a historic 70-year low, came amid mounting controversy over russian interference in the 2016 election. it emerged on saturday that trump?s campaign committee made a payment to the legal firm representing the president?s eldest son almost two weeks before a meeting between trump jr and a russian lawyer promising compromising information on hillary clinton was made public.trump now has a 36% approval rating, down six points from his first 100 days? rating. the poll found that 48% believed america?s leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office, while support for republican plans to replace barack obama?s affordable care act was at just 24% compared with 50% who support the former president?s signature healthcare policy. trump, who has spent the weekend at his private golf club in bedminster, new jersey, attempted to downplay the poll?s findings. on sunday morning he used twitter to claim, incorrectly, that ?almost 40% [approval] is not bad at this time? and that the poll in question had been ?just about the most inaccurate around election time!?.in fact, the washington post/abc poll came close to predicting the popular vote on election day ? which hillary clinton won by 2.5m ballots, trump taking the white house in the electoral college ? and no president has suffered such low ratings at this early stage in their tenure since such polling began in 1945.the poll also found that 63% of people thought the june 2016 meeting between senior members of trump?s inner circle, including donald trump jr and son-in-law jared kushner, and a group of russians including the lawyer natalia veselnitskaya, was inappropriate.on saturday, a campaign finance report filed to the federal election commission revealed that trump?s campaign committee had paid $50,000 to trump jr?s lawyer alan futerfas on 27 june, 13 days before the new york times revealed the meeting had taken place. trump himself told reporters on wednesday he had only been made aware of the 2016 meeting, which occurred in trump tower, ?two or three days ago? ? raising the prospect that his campaign committee could have known about the contact before the president did. on sunday, trump?s personal attorney jay sekulow appeared on all five tv political talk shows to offer a spurious defense of the meeting. sekulow appeared to blame secret service officers for allowing the russians into trump tower. ?i wonder why the secret service ? if this was nefarious ? why the secret service allowed these people in?? he told abc news. ?the president had secret service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.?a spokesman for the secret service later confirmed that trump jr was not under the agency?s protection at the time of the meeting and ?thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with?.under pressure from the new york times, trump jr this week released damning emails revealing he eagerly embraced what he was told was a russian government attempt to damage the clinton campaign.the emails show music promoter rob goldstone telling the future president?s son that ?the crown prosecutor of russia? had offered ?to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father?.the new york times reported that trump signed off on his son?s first statement to the times about the meeting, which like subsequent statements was soon revealed not to be a full account of events.kushner, trump?s senior adviser, and then campaign manager paul manafort also attended the meeting. it was revealed on friday that rinat akhmetshin, a russian american lobbyist and former soviet military officer, was present as well.earlier on sunday morning, trump tweeted more outspoken support for his eldest son.?hillary clinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son don is being scorned by the fake news media?? the president wrote.trump has previously described the political storm over his son?s meeting as ?the greatest witch-hunt in political history? and ?sad!? and said anyone would have taken the meeting as offered.speaking to reporters on air force one on thursday, the president said 39-year-old trump jr was ?a good boy? and added: ?and he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting. it was a short meeting, as he told me ? because i only heard about it two or three days ago.?the trump campaign committee?s finance filing also shows it paid $89,000 to the trump corporation, which is led by trump jr and his brother, eric, for ?legal consulting?.it was announced on saturday that trump had hired washington attorney ty cobb to serve as his special counsel regarding the russia investigations being run by the senate judiciary and intelligence committees and special counsel robert mueller, a former fbi director appointed after trump fired his successor james comey in may.the move seemingly reflects the president?s growing acceptance that the investigations will linger over his tenure for months or even years.on sunday morning, he also tweeted: ?thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the women?s us open. very cool!?the golfing event trump referred to took place at his club where, according to reports, members pay up to $100,000 in joining fees.

england only have four problem areas. first, the top order: they?re all left-handers, they?re all crabby, and with alastair cook?s form fading, they all struggle to deal with the stock test-match delivery. in 12 innings, cook, keaton jennings and gary ballance have made 246 at an average of 20, which is one shaky set of foundations. second, mark wood. the quickest of england?s bowlers has also been the least incisive: he has one for 197 off 56 overs. chris woakes?s recovery from injury cannot come too soon.third, liam dawson. a resourceful cricketer who bowled one great ball to dismiss amla at lord?s, dawson is summed up by one stat: in his whole career, he has taken five wickets in a first-class innings three times. the equivalent figure for adil rashid is 19. as a pair, rashid and moeen ali may be expensive, but at least they are penetrating. dawson is not. he is a bits-and-pieces player who is not even making runs.fourth, the balance of the side. the batting order is more like a disorder ? too quiet at first, then too noisy, with three blockers followed by root and four dashers. the selectors can be faulted for two things: preferring dawson to rashid, and picking only four specialist batsmen ? two of whom, jennings and ballance, are now walking wickets.updated

29th over: england 83-4 (bairstow 16, stokes 5) morkel takes the ball and rams one into bairstow?s thigh-pad. bairstow then follows one around his pads, but can?t quite apply the edge that will send him on his merry way. instead, he flicks the final delivery for four through midwicket. ?root?s dislike of rashid isn?t personal,? reassures john starbuck, ?it?s because he?s prejudiced against wrist-spinners, who leak more runs but take more wickets than the offies. as a batsman himself, the prospect of having to score more is unwelcome.?i?m not sure about that - i?d imagine he might also consider who and what he?d fancy facing. maybe he doesn?t deem rashid?s risk worth the potential reward, but if the batsmen do their job properly they can afford a luxury leg-spinner.

a couple of years ago, i wondered if england should bring eoin morgan back into the test side...eoin morgan needs another go in the test team. discuss.not everyone agreed. but i agreed with myself, and agree with this thread too.eoin morgan should be playing test cricket.maybe 11 odi centuries is as good an indication of international pedigree as scoring loads of runs against county attacks in april and may.

?on the rashid/root suggestion,? says ian truman, ?i?d be interested just how much root has played with rashid over the last 5 years, i?d suggest he?s played with him more for the england odi side (where we?d all agree rashid has been pretty decent) than he has for yorkshire. it just seems so odd given that rashid is a good batsman in his own right as well.?he?s played tests with him too - presumably he didn?t like what he saw. which isn?t to say that i get it.

 our proceedings. there was a really good stat on channel 5 on the weekend showing how little england have bowled on the stumps. now, i know that this doesn?t necessarily translate to wanting to nick batsmen off when shaping away, but surely philander?s proved ? like mcgrath before him ? that there?s simple value in making the batsman play. it?s death by a thousand cuts, as atherton, hussain et al will tell you when it came to the ashes. tall bowlers are all well and good but if you?ll never hit the stumps, where?s the pressure? someone pass me the gin.?agree with a lot of this, but morkel has been great so far this series. the difference in this match - in mine - has been the batting more than the bowling.

third set: cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 federer* (*denotes server): he?s obviously not winning this and it?s a terrible final, but i?d say cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. it would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. but federer?s still so miserly, scrooge-like when he?s serving. he offers cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

third set: cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 federer (*denotes server): alarm bells are ringing when cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. this is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when cilic nets a forehand. admirably cilic saves it with some serve-volley. then he holds. this hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. ?is this a record for unforced errors?? says henry c. ?i feel sorry for cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the women?s final.?updated

second set: cilic* 3-6, 1-5 federer (*denotes server): cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isn?t interested in long rallies. he?s drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. federer?s not going to give him anything now. he gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. federer can?t take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. but when cilic sends down an 134mph serve, federer?s flicked return brings up a second break point. federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. federer will serve for a two-set lead. updated

second set: cilic* 3-6, 0-2 federer (*denotes server): cilic makes himself feel a bit better with an ace for 30-15. it?s not long before federer has a break point, though, with cilic?s game in danger of coming apart at the seams. the errors keep on coming. cilic pulls a backhand wide and federer leads by a set and a break.

14:50

second set: cilic 3-6, 0-1 federer* (*denotes server): the good news for marin cilic is that this isn?t over yet. the bad news is that federer hasn?t lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 wimbledon final. he?s such a strong frontrunner. that?s probably why cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. he suspects this final might already be running away from him. federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.updated

serving to stay in the set, cilic?s pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. he decides it?s time to serve and volley, but he sets federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing leo messi on to his left foot. set point. a big serve forces federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from cilic brings up a second set point. cilic is showing signs of strain. he misses a first serve. his second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift federer the first set! that was all a bit flat.updated

first set: cilic* 3-4 federer (*denotes server): cilic gambols into a 40-0 lead. federer makes it 40-15 with a crisp forehand return down the line, then 40-30 with a preposterous, hypnotic backhand drop shot that draws a deeply satisfied sigh from the crowd. suddenly there?s uncertainty in cilic. from a position of dominance, it?s deuce after a double-fault, the class of federer unsettling the croatian. fortunately for cilic, federer can?t take advantage. he holds to keep the distance between them to a single break.updated

first set: cilic 2-4 federer* (*denotes server): with federer ahead, cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. federer?s backhand slice seems to head wide - it?s called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. the point?s replayed, federer skips into a 15-0 lead and it?s 40-0 before cilic has time to regroup. federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

2.32pm bst
14:32

first set: cilic* 2-3 federer (*denotes server): trailing 0-15, cilic goes for a drop shot. federer reads it. the 35-year-old springs forward to dink. cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! that exchange seems to take the wind out of cilic, who?s facing three break points after an awful forehand. he saves the first two, federer?s returns drifting long. not the third, though. cilic doesn?t move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to federer. ?could the prime minister?s presence be a bad omen for fans of roger federer?? says david wall. ?she?s been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times.? will federer end up shedding a solitary tear?updated

hello. it?s interesting. if you?re actually at wimbledon, you don?t actually have to watch a roger federer match to know how it?s going. you don?t even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. all you need to do is stand outside centre court and listen to the crowd. if they?re in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if they?re oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as federer dominance. enthusiastic applause: federer?s won the point. grudging applause: the other bloke?s not playing ball.this is how it?s supposed to go. this is federer?s kingdom, his palace from palace. there?s no desire for him to be pushed too hard. there?s no interest in an upset. sure, it?s nice to see federer?s opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but he?s not actually supposed to win. he?s supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. you are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, it?s all you?re good for here. this is the deal. there might be some pretence from the crowd that they?d like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the creuset pan instead of the john lewis own brand (other brands are available). the fed-lust can only stand so much risk.centre court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for roger. he?s nice like tim, but he?s even better at tennis. andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so he?s an excellent alternative. novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. rafa is sweet and amazing and spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isn?t an artist. none of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - that?s true class. none of them are roger. they love roger. we love you roger. i love you roger. marry me roger. did i say that out loud? oh, what am i like!this is what stands in front of marin cilic today: federer the player and federer the legend. he isn?t supposed to win. it?s not that the seventh seed isn?t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated swiss coronation. it?s just that he isn?t roger. nor is the former us open champion much of a character, a card. he?s just a guy who?s good at tennis. unlike goran ivanisevic, the last croatian man to win wimbledon, there?s no good marin, bad marin and emergency marin. there?s just marin. it might not be enough to win their affections.it could be enough to win this final, though. cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed federer on the way to winning the us open in 2014. at his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. if the 28-year-old doesn?t freeze, he could do something here. he was two sets up against federer in their quarter-final last year. underestimate him at your peril. but for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn?t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. and last year he had that knee injury. this time he?s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he?s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. it?s brought him another australian open title, his 18th major, and titles in miami and indian wells. it could bring him an historic eighth wimbledon title.this is cilic?s second grand slam final. it?s federer?s 11th here and his 29th overall. he?s 36 in less than a month. this isn?t normal. but he isn?t normal. you wonder when it?s going to end. is it going to end? you know what they want on centre court. more roger. they can?t get enough roger. and do you know? it?s because there?s nothing else quite like it.play begins at: 2pm bst.updated

third set: cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 federer* (*denotes server): he?s obviously not winning this and it?s a terrible final, but i?d say cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. it would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. but federer?s still so miserly, scrooge-like when he?s serving. he offers cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

third set: cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 federer (*denotes server): alarm bells are ringing when cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. this is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when cilic nets a forehand. admirably cilic saves it with some serve-volley. then he holds. this hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. ?is this a record for unforced errors?? says henry c. ?i feel sorry for cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the women?s final.?updated

second set: cilic* 3-6, 1-5 federer (*denotes server): cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isn?t interested in long rallies. he?s drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. federer?s not going to give him anything now. he gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. federer can?t take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. but when cilic sends down an 134mph serve, federer?s flicked return brings up a second break point. federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. federer will serve for a two-set lead. updated

second set: cilic 3-6, 0-1 federer* (*denotes server): the good news for marin cilic is that this isn?t over yet. the bad news is that federer hasn?t lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 wimbledon final. he?s such a strong frontrunner. that?s probably why cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. he suspects this final might already be running away from him. federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.updated

serving to stay in the set, cilic?s pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. he decides it?s time to serve and volley, but he sets federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing leo messi on to his left foot. set point. a big serve forces federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from cilic brings up a second set point. cilic is showing signs of strain. he misses a first serve. his second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift federer the first set! that was all a bit flat.updated

first set: cilic 2-4 federer* (*denotes server): with federer ahead, cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. federer?s backhand slice seems to head wide - it?s called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. the point?s replayed, federer skips into a 15-0 lead and it?s 40-0 before cilic has time to regroup. federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

14:32

first set: cilic* 2-3 federer (*denotes server): trailing 0-15, cilic goes for a drop shot. federer reads it. the 35-year-old springs forward to dink. cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! that exchange seems to take the wind out of cilic, who?s facing three break points after an awful forehand. he saves the first two, federer?s returns drifting long. not the third, though. cilic doesn?t move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to federer. ?could the prime minister?s presence be a bad omen for fans of roger federer?? says david wall. ?she?s been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times.? will federer end up shedding a solitary tear?updated

hello. it?s interesting. if you?re actually at wimbledon, you don?t actually have to watch a roger federer match to know how it?s going. you don?t even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. all you need to do is stand outside centre court and listen to the crowd. if they?re in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if they?re oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as federer dominance. enthusiastic applause: federer?s won the point. grudging applause: the other bloke?s not playing ball.this is how it?s supposed to go. this is federer?s kingdom, his palace from palace. there?s no desire for him to be pushed too hard. there?s no interest in an upset. sure, it?s nice to see federer?s opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but he?s not actually supposed to win. he?s supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. you are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, it?s all you?re good for here. this is the deal. there might be some pretence from the crowd that they?d like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the creuset pan instead of the john lewis own brand (other brands are available). the fed-lust can only stand so much risk.centre court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for roger. he?s nice like tim, but he?s even better at tennis. andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so he?s an excellent alternative. novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. rafa is sweet and amazing and spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isn?t an artist. none of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - that?s true class. none of them are roger. they love roger. we love you roger. i love you roger. marry me roger. did i say that out loud? oh, what am i like!this is what stands in front of marin cilic today: federer the player and federer the legend. he isn?t supposed to win. it?s not that the seventh seed isn?t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated swiss coronation. it?s just that he isn?t roger. nor is the former us open champion much of a character, a card. he?s just a guy who?s good at tennis. unlike goran ivanisevic, the last croatian man to win wimbledon, there?s no good marin, bad marin and emergency marin. there?s just marin. it might not be enough to win their affections.it could be enough to win this final, though. cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed federer on the way to winning the us open in 2014. at his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. if the 28-year-old doesn?t freeze, he could do something here. he was two sets up against federer in their quarter-final last year. underestimate him at your peril. but for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn?t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. and last year he had that knee injury. this time he?s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he?s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. it?s brought him another australian open title, his 18th major, and titles in miami and indian wells. it could bring him an historic eighth wimbledon title.this is cilic?s second grand slam final. it?s federer?s 11th here and his 29th overall. he?s 36 in less than a month. this isn?t normal. but he isn?t normal. you wonder when it?s going to end. is it going to end? you know what they want on centre court. more roger. they can?t get enough roger. and do you know? it?s because there?s nothing else quite like it.play begins at: 2pm bst.updated

that a handful of rich men headed by the microsoft founder bill gates are worth $426bn (£350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.the development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain brexit and donald trump?s victory in the us presidential election.oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.the world economic forum (wef) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.oxfam said the world?s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by gates, amancio ortega, the founder of the spanish fashion chain zara, and warren buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of berkshire hathaway.the others are carlos slim helú: the mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate grupo carso; jeff bezos: the founder of amazon; mark zuckerberg: the founder of facebook; larry ellison, chief executive of us tech firm oracle; and michael bloomberg; a former mayor of new york and founder and owner of the bloomberg news and financial information service.last year, oxfam said the world?s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world?s population. however, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in china and india is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.with members of the forum due to arrive on monday in switzerland, where guests will range from the chinese president xi jinping, to pop star shakira, the wef released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.norway, luxembourg, switzerland, iceland and denmark filled the top five places in the wef?s inclusive development index, with britain 21st and the us 23rd. the body that organises the davos event said rising inequality was not an ?iron law of capitalism?, but a matter of making the right policy choices.the wef report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, ?attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress?.basing its research on the forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank credit suisse, oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world?s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. it was four years since the wef had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, oxfam added.?from brexit to the success of donald trump?s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,? the report said.the charity said new information had shown that poor people in china and india owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.mark goldring, chief executive of oxfam gb, said: ?this year?s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. it is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. ?while one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. the fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.?mark littlewood, director general at the institute of economic affairs thinktank, said: ?once again oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.?the oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. it said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs ? a sum larger than the annual gdp of india, a country with 1.3 billion people. between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 ?

Ankush Verma,15 Jul 2017,a town in colorado requires every household to own a gun,www.theguardian.com,"a town in colorado, us in 2013 passed an ordinance requiring every household to own a gun. members of the nucla town board voted 5-1 in favour of the ordinance, which was inspired by the family protection ordinance passed by the town of kennesaw, georgia in 1982. the ordinance provides for the emergency management and general safety of the residents.","there?s an empty stretch of field off highway 141 in colorado that used to be the perfect american town. small houses with white picket fences boasted big flower gardens. kids played kick the can in the streets, rode their bikes, splashed in swimming pools. on sundays, they might have watched an elvis movie on tv. the rent was cheap, the fathers all worked, the mothers stayed at home.uravan was placid, friendly and, in most of the ways people usually measure it, safe. for many years, a former resident recalled, there was no law enforcement in the mining company town. nobody needed it. the kids were good kids, because if they weren?t, the company bosses would kick their whole families out. the town, named after the minerals extracted and processed there, had secretly supplied uranium to the manhattan project during the war. afterward, the cold war uranium boom made the town prosper. things changed in 1986 when uravan was declared a superfund site contaminated by hazardous waste. the mine closed, residents moved out. the entire town ? the trees, the houses, the post office, the coke glasses from the drug store ? was shredded and buried in a concrete-lined hole. the only thing left behind was the town?s metal flagpole, which was moved to the abandoned baseball field.?when they bury your whole town, they bury your history. there?s a little bit of shame to that,? said jane thompson, who grew up in uravan. her parents were the second to last family to move out.thompson drove me through uravan early one sunday morning, pointing to the dip in the ground where the gas station had been, the block of houses where she had grown up. there was nothing left except scrub, battered earth and fences with signs warning, ?caution ?? radioactive materials.?thomas and her family now live just down the road in nucla, a shrinking rural town still dependent on the mining industry.nucla became nationally famous when it passed an ordinance requiring every household to own a gun five years ago ? a move that is still wildly popular among residents. but past nucla?s one minute of fame, locals worry about their beloved home becoming a ghost town.in september, in the wake of a lawsuit from an environmental group, nucla?s major employer, the local coal-fired power plant, announced that it would be shutting down in 2022. the coal mine that supplied the plant would be shutting down as well. in total, about 80 jobs were at risk ? a huge number in a town whose population boasted, according to the 2010 census, only 711 people. for locals, this decision was a death knell brought on by liberals who live in big cities. nucla residents bristle at the warnings about the risk of exposure to radiation, and roll their eyes at a-listers like darryl hannah, the hollywood actress known for splash and kill bill, who joined the activism against the local uranium industry. liberals fighting against the mining industry are good at telling them no, residents say, but don?t present them with any alternatives ? not ones that come with real salaries. richard craig, a former nucla town board member, recalled a comment by a member of an environmental group saying during one of the contentious hearings: ?well, i don?t see why they don?t want to go live in the city.??it?s almost like ? i hate using this word, it?s being used so often ? it?s almost like a conspiracy: ?we need to move everybody out of rural areas and go live in the cities and suburbs,?? craig said.nucla made national headlines in 2013. that year, in the wake of the sandy hook mass shooting that left 20 first-graders dead, colorado passed new gun control laws, banning the sale of new ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds and requiring that private citizens perform criminal background checks before selling guns to each other. the laws were hailed by gun control advocates nationwide as a sign of progress despite the gun debate stalemate in washington.nucla moved in precisely the opposite direction: it passed an ordinance mandating that every head of household had to own a gun. kennesaw, georgia, had passed a similar ordinance in 1982. after craig heard about it, he proposed the idea in a town board meeting. ?it was kind of a joke to start with,? he said, sunk deep into the blue plush chair in his cluttered living room. but the reaction from other town board members was immediately positive. nucla locals, who had been fighting with liberals for years over uranium and coal, loved the idea. ?they said, ?that sounds cool,?? he says. ?i went, ?uh-oh.??craig received congratulatory phone calls from gun rights groups across the country, and the town took the national media attention in stride. locals still talk fondly of the controversy over the town?s prairie dog shooting contest in 1990, which attracted dozens of animal rights activists and made the pages of people magazine. (during the shoot, the los angeles times reported, picketers chanted ?what are you gonna shoot when the prairie dogs are gone?? and a local woman called out: ?protesters!?)craig himself saw the ordinance as responding to yet another irrational liberal attack on rural jobs. after colorado passed its law on magazine limits, magpul, a company that manufactures firearms accessories, left the state of colorado in protest for wyoming, where it reportedly expanded its workforce and secured a lucrative contract to provide ammunition magazines to the us marine corps. but he was dismissive of barack obama?s controversial analysis during his 2008 campaign that small-town residents ?get bitter? and ?cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren?t like them? as a way to channel their frustration. ?the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing?s replaced them,? obama had said. ?and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.? craig maintains that nucla?s love of guns is not rooted in bitterness. even before the new rule was approved, most people in nucla were already gun owners. the ordinance itself contains broad exceptions, not only for felons and those with a mental illness, but also for people who cannot afford a gun or simply wish to be ?conscientious objectors?. this makes it more or less unenforceable.still, nucla?s commitment to gun ownership is no joke. there?s a tiny pink sign decorated with pistols at the local sheriff?s department ? it reads: ?we don?t call 911.? the town has no bars, no liquor stores, no movie theaters or malls, but it does have its own public gun range, free for use by all. the few local democrats are no exception, including craig himself and the local pharmacist, who was a prize-winning competitive shooter in college. nucla?s historian, marie templeton, keeps a beloved gun her husband gave her as an anniversary gift. ?i?m sure that the people who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means to a person in a small town like this. what do you use a gun for? well, you kill rattlesnakes, for one thing!? she said. she got up from her kitchen table to fetch a stack of photographs of mountain lions and bears that had been spotted in her neighbor?s yard. the ordinance didn?t even faze shirley miller, an englishwoman who moved from essex to be with her american husband. she said her adjustment was easy for the most part. coming from a small village to the east of london, great wakering, she finds small-town england and small-town america mostly alike, except for nucla?s blazing, dusty summers and, of course, its bounteous guns.that aside, nucla?s culture is not so different from small english villages, miller said: the lack of diversity; the mix of open-mindedness and old prejudice among the residents. there have been small adjustments. she imports her tesco and yorkshire tea by mail, along with the occasional package of sultanas and marmite, and each year she lets a friend?s sheep graze in the empty pasture by her house, adding a nice pastoral touch to the property. she refuses to say a word against the gun ordinance. people who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means in a side town like this?although i come from a culture where there are no guns, and it?s different here, i don?t see the problem here in nucla,? she said diplomatically. ?if i were living in the city [these gun laws] would worry me. here it doesn?t,? she said before adding wryly: ?there is no crossfire here.?even the town?s emergency medical technician ? the major healthcare provider in the area during the night, when the local clinic is closed ? said he carried a gun, as did the ambulance driver. the emt, jeff stephens, said the ambulance had been held up twice.last november, officials said, a heavily armed man with a history of anger at law enforcement opened fire on a sheriff?s deputy while he was driving in a remote area not far from nucla. the officer returned fire, killing the man. a local prosecutor found the officer?s actions justified.but that shooting was an anomaly for the area. ?prior to that, the last violent shooting was in 1986 or so,? stephens said, when a man tried to break up a fight between a man and his wife outside a bar in naturita, the town next door, and was shot to death.stephens said he does see occasional firearm accidents. there were two in recent memory: one a man shooting himself in the leg, another a young man shooting his partner in the knee. both shootings involved alcohol, he said.word travels quickly in a town of a few hundred people. i had given craig, the architect of the gun ordinance, a call in advance of my trip to nucla, and shortly after i arrived in town he tried to reach me on my cellphone. i didn?t immediately pick up, so craig called the front desk of the hotel one town over, and a hotel employee dashed downstairs as i was starting to eat lunch. she handed me a fluorescent post-it note: it had craig?s name and home number on it.by my third day in town, a woman stopped me outside of nucla?s one restaurant, the fifth avenue grill, to recommend someone for an interview. had we met the day before? i wondered, confused. we had not. but she had heard all about me already. later that day, a stranger in the burger joint one town over, a 1950s-style diner run by seventh day adventists, broke into my note-taking to warn me that i had better be writing a nice story. i pulled up a chair to his family?s table. his son was just hoping the jobs would hang on long enough for his daughter to graduate from high school. many of the residents were no strangers to the boom-bust cycle of the mining industry. it?s always been boom and bust, they told me, for the past hundred years. sharon johannsen, jane thompson?s sister, had been forced to leave town during a mining slump. her family had only been able to return many years later, but her husband was now working at the coal mine that was slated to be closed.many end up moving away for good, but the ones who stay or return are fiercely committed to the landscape and the isolation, the need for self-reliance. the nearest walmart is more than two hours away. on the mile marker partway down the winding 100-mile road that leads to the closest hospital, locals have tied a pink ribbon to commemorate the place where a healthy little girl had recently been born.grand junction, that nearest larger town, has a population of just over 60,000. several nucla residents told me, with disgust, that they could not imagine living in a town that big, and some said they tried to visit as little as possible. multiple men confided woefully that nucla had a hard time attracting managers for certain jobs because their wives could not bear to live so far away from a shopping centre.today, western colorado is perceived as a conservative region. at a blues in the park night in naturita, a stranger visiting the town, red-faced and somewhat inebriated, cornered me and began ranting about freeloading immigrants and american values. ?this country wasn?t built by socialists!? he told me. ?actually,? i said politely, ?this area, right here, this was built by socialists.? in 1893, a financial crisis devastated thousands of companies and caused the unemployment rate to spike above 10% for several years. workers lost their homes and families went hungry. according to one history of the town, a group of denver families who had become homeless and who were ?united in their wish to escape tyrannical landlords? provided the impetus. in 1894, a group of 10 idealists in denver formed the colorado co-operative company, with the goal of moving into the wilderness to create a new community ? a place ?where equality and service rather than greed and competition should be the basis?.the utopians spent nearly10 years digging an 18-mile irrigation canal through the arid landscape to bring water from the san miguel river to the dry hill where they planned to build their colony. money was tight, food scarce and the workers labored for shares in the eventual water rights in the canal they were digging by hand. to outsiders, the whole plan seemed like madness: how could anyone build a major irrigation canal without any capital? to expand their group of workers and supporters, the cooperative society established a newspaper, the altrurian, to share news about their progress nationwide. it covered the day-to-day debates, including updates on the type of cabbages and lettuces that had been planted to feed the workers, as well as features on vegetarianism, marriage and violent labor strikes in other states. the paper advertised in-person cooperative club meetings across the country, including in brooklyn, and was not too proud to beg for subscription pennies. ?if you have received one cent?s worth of information from this week?s altrurian, and are not already a subscriber, can you not afford to be a subscriber?? it prompted.when the ditch was finished, the utopians named their town nucla after the word nucleus, a strange premonition of the town?s nuclear future. socialism broke down only a few years later. in 1914, nucla voted down its ?single tax? system, in which the cooperative company owned all the land in town and paid one tax on it to the government, in favor of private ownership.today, thompson argues, it?s the labels on the town?s politics that have changed, more than the values themselves. the old-school cooperative mindset ?really maybe has more to do with conservatism than we think: independent, not needing the government, not needing a landlord, not needing a boss or a big corporation?.the ditch is still owned and managed collectively by the colorado co-operative company, which the utopians founded in 1894. it has about 170 shareholders, and in the summer, group meetings have to be held late in the evening to make it easier for local ranchers to attend after work.monte and his son dean naslund have a strong connection to the ditch: five generations of their family have worked rebuilding and maintaining it over the years.i drove out with dean late one morning, after the day?s first real work had been done. the ditch was unlined, just a channel dug in the dirt, 16-20ft wide at the top, carefully designed to flow downhill all the way from the san miguel river to nucla.naslund stopped periodically to use a pitchfork to clear branches out of ditch gratings. the back of the pickup was filled with tools, mixed with old chunks of red-and-black rock ? fossilized dinosaur bone, naslund said. golf balls sit near the front seat. he finds them ?floating down the ditch ? from telluride, i suspect?.golf balls aren?t the only trace of the liberal resort town that end up downstream in nucla?s water. ?there?s been a few people who say they found some other things from telluride,? naslund said, and paused. ?sexual endeavor things,? he added, delicately. telluride, just an hour away, is nucla?s polar opposite. the town, which hosts a film festival, is cosmopolitan and populated by the elite, a favored site for second or even third homes. oprah winfrey reportedly bought 60 acres of land there in 2014 and spent $14m on one of the town?s most lavish mansions (it has a wine cellar designed to look like a historic mine). to make ends meet, nucla residents clean telluride?s rental condos and help construct its elaborate mansions, with their enormous chandeliers and granite toilet seats and computerized bidets. one nucla resident recalled walking into a bathroom in telluride and feeling startled as ?the toilet opened by itself?.the class tensions between the two towns are exacerbated by stereotypes. telluride people think the small towners? exposure to radiation means they ?can?t think properly?, said kyle webb, a 28-year-old who had moved from denver to nucla, in part because of its gun ordinance. meanwhile, the avowed environmentalists are building giant mansions with heated driveways to melt the snow. telluride is ?so wasteful ? and it?s kind of hypocritical?, said aimee tooker, thompson?s niece and the the president of the west end economic development corporation, which was founded to help build new economic models in the area.?it?s the saddest thing. you know, we turn off our lights. and as long as we have a place to plug in our phone and our tv, we?re happy. those people that are up there ? they have rain sensors in their windows and sun sensors in their shades so that the shades will close automatically.?they?re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that, you know, we can?t have our uranium, we can?t have this and that down here.? they?re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that we can?t have our uranium, we can?t have this and that down herethe two communities especially clashed during the push to reopen a uranium mill near telluride, a raging fight that started around 2009. hilary cooper, a telluride resident who was then the head of the sheep mountain alliance, a telluride environmental group, was one of the leaders who geared up to fight the uranium mill. ?i kind of jumped into those communities thinking, oh, we can talk some sense into these people: all the medical research and how bad this stuff was for them and how bad it was for the environment,? cooper said. she knew the environmental arguments might not be as powerful, even if she stuck to the simple talking points of clean air and clean water. ?i could not have been more wrong in my approach,? she said.her activism sparked outrage, and she said she received threats on her life. the children and grandchildren of uravan miners had seen some of them die of lung cancer, but they never missed an opportunity to explain that they had been smokers too. the direct links they saw between exposure to uranium and cancer did not persuade them that uranium mining was a bad industry, especially with what the saw as more recent advances in safety. thompson?s grandfather, who used to smoke and mine at the same time, had died of lung cancer. the local history museum has a photo of him smoking insouciantly while wheeling a cart of ore out of the mine. ?if you had told my grandpa that he was going to die when he was 70 a horrible, painful death, he would have continued to mine,? thompson said. ?that?s how he supported his family and he was able to keep his family farm.? as an alternative to uranium, telluride residents repeatedly suggested that nucla and naturita capitalize on the organic local food movement and return to their farming roots to provide telluride and surrounding areas with produce, cooper said.this suggestion was met with eye-rolling and frustration. ?i?ll be the first person in line to pick your tomatoes for $45,000 to $75,000 a year,? one local reportedly said in 2009, contrasting agricultural wages with mining income. years later, thompson still scoffs at the mention of organic produce. her grandmother grew her own food and canned it, and never used pesticides. ?this is our way of life,? she said. after several years of angry public hearings, lawsuits and debates, the uranium project has been put on hold for economic reasons. in nucla, where the spot price of uranium is printed on the front page of the newspaper, locals say it needs to reach $50 for the mill to be financially viable. the price listed on the paper in late june was $19.85. ?telluride says a lot of dumb things,? said paul major, the president of the telluride foundation, a community philanthropy. ?you know, it?s easier to sit in telluride and yodel about going green, and a community like nucla is going, ?what are you talking about?? we?re just trying to put food on our table and a roof over our heads.??it was not easy for people working in information industries, or in tourism and real estate, to understand what it was like to be dependent on extraction industries, he said. if you had told my grandpa he was going to die a horrible,painful death at 70, he would have continued to minethompson said that during a tour of urvan for telluride schoolchildren, their teacher asked her: ?so how do you kind of live with yourself, knowing that the town where you grew up in is where the bomb came from that killed all those people in japan?? thompson said: ?and i just looked at him, like, are you just stupid or are you just rude? what kind of question is that??my grandfather was a farmer, he was a kind and gentle man that wouldn?t hurt a fly ... he had no idea what he was doing. none of them knew what they were doing.?i had a hard time with that man even asking me that question.? cooper, who was recently elected as a county commissioner in a neighboring county, representing telluride, said she has learned the limits of the town?s helpful suggestions. ?telluride is very well meaning in a patriarchal kind of way. we?ve got all kinds of ideas about what would be good for the west end. unless it comes from within the west end, our ideas are not going to fly there,? she said. she thought some of the criticisms of the resort town have merit. ?i, too, am frustrated with telluride?s energy use and with the 19-bedroom second homes that are still consuming energy when nobody is in the house year round. that said, don?t let that stop a good idea from happening. don?t use that as an excuse not to move forward with something that would help your community.?lacey steele, a nucla native, has been commuting to work in telluride since she was 15 and now works at a starbucks there. at 21, she?s starting a family and getting ready to have a baby. ?everybody there looks down on it ? young marriage and young families,? she said. she?s one of the only people at work who?s preparing to have children at all.she sees an imbalance of power even in the way the residents of the two towns think of each other. ?i don?t believe that a lot of people in telluride know what goes on around here. a lot of them don?t even know where we are.? and some of the work its millionaire tourist economy offers has real drawbacks: it?s seasonal, which means steele is laid off twice a year in the spring and fall and then re-hired.laura denney, a nucla resident who does private housekeeping in telluride, said there is an ?amazing difference? in lifestyles between the two towns. at the same time, she said, the families she worked for were ?really down-to-earth people? who she saw give back to the broader community. she pushed back against the negative views of telluride residents in nucla. ?a lot of people still have that feeling: ?they?re just a bunch of hippies up there, just a bunch of rich people.? you know what? it was the hippies that made telluride rich ... if it wasn?t for the people in telluride, a lot of us here in nucla, naturita and norwood wouldn?t have jobs.?residents of nucla ?do have this really strong attachment to their culture and their history?, cooper said. over the years, she?s come to believe that attachment is mixed with shame. the history of nucla ?is not taught in schools, it?s not shared ... there?s a conflict of being both ashamed and being proud of it ? and i think in some ways that is what has really kept that community from discovering what?s next for them if it?s not uranium.?jeremy nichols, the climate energy program director at wildearth guardians, the not-for-profit whose lawsuit led to the closure of nucla?s power plant, is unabashed about his goals. ?we want to shut down all coal-fired power plants. we want to keep all coal in the ground. we have a moral imperative to confront the climate crisis, and we can?t afford to say, ?it?s ok for this power plant to run and not the others.??the scheduled shutdown is ?an uncomfortable situation for sure for them?, he said. but the timeline, and the deadline, also have benefits, he argued. they provide certainty about something that was already going to happen, and cut through the rhetoric that might suggest, inaccurately, ?that coal is great and it?s going to go on forever and if anybody says otherwise, they?re lying?.the town has to take responsibility for planning its own future, and for the lack of planning in the past. ?it?s a beautiful landscape, but it?s stuck in an old economy, and the old economy is going belly-up, and nucla hasn?t planned for that,? he said.one autumn 16 years ago, monte naslund, whose family has worked on the irrigation ditch for decades, was at cow camp, where cattle graze in the summer in the mountains near nucla. it was always quiet up there, but on that day he noticed something different. the rumble of airplanes overhead, a constant background buzz even on a mountaintop, had stopped. he was listening to a depth of silence he had not heard since he was a boy.only much later, when he came down off the mountain, would naslund learn why it was so silent. terrorists had flown airplanes into both the world trade center and the pentagon, and civilian flights had been grounded nationwide. more than 2,000 miles from the stunned new yorkers who had watched the towers fall, naslund had been able to hear the nation coming to a halt. around nucla these days, there?s a sense that many of the residents are listening intensely ? that the seismic shift they are experiencing, as urban and rural priorities clash across the world, is audible to them. some in town are optimistic that they will find a way forward: expand the nucla airport for commercial flights, turn the old elementary school building into a hemp manufacturing center, finally mobilize tourism to nucla?s canyons, rivers and bike trails. others are doubtful that hemp will make much difference, and question whether nucla?s natural landscape ? beautiful, but without the show-stopping monuments of moab or zion ? could ever become a true tourist destination. the town lies off the highway; it is not on the way to anywhere. miller, who runs an airbnb in her house, said the guests she gets stay for just one night, stopping over on their way somewhere else.thompson, who is also the president of the local historical society, is doing what she can to celebrate the town?s more positive history. there is a uravan reunion picnic every year to bring together old residents of the town. in 2012, the event had attracted an estimated 1,000 people. they served yellow cake in tribute to yellowcake (milled uranium oxide). in the fall, she?s planning to host an all-terrain-vehicle tour of the entire length of the socialist ditch. but progress on building a larger museum is slow and after years of effort, thompson said that nucla and naturita still feel like an afterthought to the broader world, their culture and history less of a priority. ?we really are a lower class people. i don?t know how to say that in a nice way,? she said.for cooper, the telluride commissioner, nucla was founded with a pioneering spirit, and its residents still have it. ?if they could tap into that and take advantage of it,? she said, ?i think the sky?s the limit.?this article was co-published with topic, a new storytelling studio. sign up for our newsletter here",NEUTRAL,0.7577760219573975

first set: williams 5-6 muguruza* (*denotes next server)?this is a brutal set of tennis, with both players seemingly trying to hit each other not so much off the court but out of sw19 altogether,? writes guy hornsby. ?in many ways muguruza is the heir to the williams sisters? power crown. this is shaping up to be a classic, but who will blink first? i feel williams will want to finish this in two.?at 15-all, williams?s shot is called out. she appeals to hawk-eye. it was well in. the point is replayed. but this time williams rattles well long after some awkward footwork. 15-30, perhaps williams hasn?t quite got those missed set points out of her mind. she recovers to 30-all but then clatters a forehand into the net. and from two set points up, she?s now break point down. muguruza then shows her nerves with a shaky forehand. deuce. advantage muguruza, after the spaniard finds her forehand again. some brutal hitting from both - they go at each other again and again and again, and williams goes long! muguruza claims the first break of this final and will serve for the first set! an error-strewn but compelling game. updated

at the beginning of this fortnight, much of the talk at the all england club was about the resurgence of a former champion reaching for another wimbledon crown. but it was roger federer, rather than the five-time champion two years his senior who hadn?t won a grand slam singles title since 2008.in many ways, it?s surprising that venus williams wasn?t regarded as one of the favourites for the women?s title from the start. the 37-year-old has been a model of consistency over the past year, suggesting she has finally found a way of managing the auto-immune disease that she was diagnosed with in 2011 and that prevented her from being a contender for several years. she arrived at wimbledon having reached at least the last 16 in her past five majors, including at this year?s australian open, where she lost to her sister ? then eight weeks pregnant - in the final. so often has venus been stalled by serena in slams ? six of her seven final defeats have been at the hands of her younger sibling ? that serena?s absence here removed one of her most familiar obstacles.however, williams was burdened by the fatal car accident she was involved in last month, the details of which emerged only three days before the start of wimbledon. asked about the incident after her first-round win, she broke down in tears at her press conference. she struggled in the second round, coming from a set down to advance. that was the last set she dropped. perhaps using her tennis as a refuge, she started to gain momentum. there was a certain symbolism to her victories over naomi osaka, ana konjuh and the recent french open champion jelena ostapenko, who were all born in 1997, the year williams made her wimbledon debut. then in the semi-finals, williams had the look of a champion as she clinically ended the run of johanna konta.now the only player standing between williams and the title is garbine muguruza, who knows exactly what it?s like to lose to serena in a grand slam final. the spaniard was runner-up here in 2015 before securing her first major title at the french open last year. a dip in form followed but she has rediscovered her touch this fortnight, under the guidance of her temporary coach conchita martinez, the 1994 wimbledon champion. muguruza, like williams, hits hard, so this will be a match of few subtleties. muguruza will know that much of the narrative surrounding this final is about williams but she is more than capable of writing her own story this afternoon. the players will be on court at: 2pm bst. do remember you can get in touch: via email or twitter.updated

Deepali Aggarwal,15 Jul 2017,corpses seen floating in river near isis-liberated city,www.theguardian.com,"unidentified dead bodies are spotted floating almost daily in the tigris river near the recently isis-liberated iraqi city of mosul, according to reports. the bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of isis militants by the iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation human rights watch has alleged. soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital.","the bodies washed up with grim regularity on the banks of the tigris downstream from mosul, a daily reminder of the vicious fight against islamic state that played out a few dozen miles away.all were heavily decomposed, most bound and blindfolded, some mutilated. the corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of qayyarah.?i see dead bodies in the water daily,? said ahmed mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. ?the number has increased since early april. there were five bodies floating in the river recently in one single day. they are young men with their hands tied behind their back and are blindfolded.?iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi this week declared victory after nearly nine months of fierce fighting to displace the extremist group from the city where it proclaimed its ?caliphate? in 2014. but as mosul lies in ruins ? and the last women and children emerge from the rubble ? a bloody picture of the campaign?s impact is emerging. local people who spotted corpses midstream would try to catch them and then call the army, mohammed said. soldiers then take them to a makeshift morgue at the city?s general hospital, run by mansour maroof mansour. most of the dead found in the river with some identifiable features intact were young men who appeared to be in their late 20s, said mansour, but he has learned little else about who they were. ?we can?t identify the bodies in the river. they are very decomposed and there is nothing on them to use for identification,? he said, standing in a room filled with dozens of bodybags. none had been claimed, and even that toll of the unknown dead is not exhaustive; some bodies are lost.?(once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier,? said the driver mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the tigris river. human rights watch (hrw) said evidence points to government forces, killing suspected isis members or collaborators without trial or due process.warning of the killings in april, lama fakih, deputy middle east director for hrw said: ?the bodies of bound and blindfolded men are being found one after the other in and around mosul and in the tigris river, raising serious concerns about extrajudicial killings by government forces. the lack of any apparent government action to investigate these deaths undermines the government?s statements on protecting detainee rights.?little has been done to investigate the killings, however. ?the horrors that the people of mosul have witnessed and the disregard for human life by all parties to this conflict must not go unpunished,? lynn maalouf, research director for amnesty international in the middle east, said. the violence upstream casts a long shadow in qayyarah, which was freed from isis rule at the start of the nine-month mosul campaign. most residents are reluctant even to talk about the bodies in the river. ?i don?t know anything about that subject,? said one fishmonger in the newly re-opened market, buzzing with soldiers and militia fighters.isis exploited iraq?s sectarian tensions to facilitate its rise to power. many sunnis who felt disenfranchised by the shia majority government or feared becoming targets of security forces welcomed or at least tolerated the group?s arrival in 2014. as the extremism and violence of isis world view became clearer, many sunnis left or privately turned against the group, but suspicions of collaboration linger and in some sunni areas a sense of apprehension remains.?blood for blood,? reads graffiti on a wall of a house in qayyarah that locals say belonged to ali khether, a well-known isis commander who had lived in the town. he is described by one as ?the child of adultery, ali khether, the daeshi? ? a name that refers to daesh, a pejorative name for isis.close by stands the town?s small stadium where isis, with the aid of local people, killed dozens, with the most cursory of trials, on charges ranging from spying for the security services to homosexualitynow as isis retreats to the syrian city of raqqa and desert areas of western iraq, those who were on the receiving end of their brutality for over two years have set up their own militia groups. loosely attached to the popular mobilisation units (pmu), they are taking the law into their own hands.?pmu militias have carried out a systematic pattern of violations, including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings and torture of sunni arab men and boys, seemingly in revenge for is attacks,? said amnesty international in a report earlier this year.security forces who retook the town found the bodies of many isis victims that had been dumped in the river, said walid khaled an officer at qayyarah police station, but he had no idea who the more recent waves of dead might be. ?we don?t know where they come from, they are unidentified,? he said.some in the town say the bodies are more isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in mosul, but the iraqi security forces had blocked the river around 20km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water. territory further down river towards qayyarah has been in the control of iraqi security forces for months.a soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting munirah village, around 20km south of mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.he showed the guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water. ?he was daesh hiding in the reeds and we killed him,?

he wrote on twitter.in germany, the rightwing populist party, alternative für deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: ?the ecj?s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for germany,? said the afd?s berlin leader, georg pazderski. ?of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.?the ecj issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from france and belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.?an internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,? the court said.it ruled that a company?s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.the first case was referred to the ecj by the belgian courts. samira achbita had been a receptionist for the belgian branch of g4s, the london-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. achbita was fired in june 2006 for refusing to take off her scarf. the company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.in the second case, asma bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an it consultancy firm, micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been ?embarrassed? by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. she had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company?s customers.in achbita?s case the ecj followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.?the court of justice finds that g4s?s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. the rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.?in bougnaoui?s case the court?s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. she had been ?professionally competent? and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.the court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. it said customers? wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from eu anti-discrimination law. ?however, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer?s services provided by a worker wearing an islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.?the ecj did not rule on whether bougnaoui?s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the french court to determine.the german broadsheet süddeutsche zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how german courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. the ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the european court of human rights (echr) that allowed crosses to be worn.steve peers, a professor of eu law at essex university, said the latest ecj ruling looked awkward when set against the echr judgment that wearing religious symbols is ?sometimes an employee?s right to manifest freedom of religion?. he said the ecj had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.the echr is the high court of the 47-member council of europe and not part of the eu. traditionally, the eu court in luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in europe?s single market, but its remit has grown as eu law has expanded.the ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. the conference of european rabbis, which comprises 700 jewish leaders across europe, said europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, pinchas goldschmidt, the group?s president, called on politicians to ensure europe did not isolate religious minorities.maryam h?madoun at the open society justice initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. ?it will lead to muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also jewish men who wear kippas, sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. it affects all of them, but disproportionately muslim women,? she said.stephen evans, the campaigns director at the national secular society in the uk, said: ?where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can?t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ?less favourable treatment?.?religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.?angelique chrisafis contributed to this report",SUBJECTIVE,0.6633232235908508

and then there was one. well sure, there are actually three, but there?s only one member of the big four left, and he?s the one who?s going to win it, right? while andy murray limped, novak djokovic winced and rafael nadal was bundled out before his grass-court revival could gather any more pace, roger federer has spent this fortnight looking as serene as he did a decade ago when he was collecting all those wimbledon titles for fun ? minus the silly suits, gold-trimmed man-bags and cardigans emblazoned with rf. perhaps the 35-year-old has a greater sense of humility and of appreciating the moment now, and if he were to win an eighth wimbledon crown five years after his last it may mean more than any of the others, apart from possibly the first in 2003.the numbers for federer this year and this fortnight are remarkable. his win-loss record for 2017 is 29-2. he?s won four of the six tournaments he?s played, including the australian open, his 18th grand slam title. he warmed up for wimbledon by lifting the title at halle for a ninth time. he hasn?t dropped a set on his way to the semi-finals here and has only been broken three times. and all of this after he took six months out last year for knee surgery. perhaps the ailing murray and djokovic should take note.today?s opponent is the czech world no15, tomas berdych, who was the wimbledon runner-up in 2010, when he enjoyed his best run at a grand slam, beating federer and djokovic before losing to nadal in the final. the 31-year-old also hit the headlines in this country in 2015 when he was on the receiving end of a sweary outburst from andy murray?s wife kim during a match at the australian open. ?flash fuck? appeared to be her choice words but ?sitting duck? may describe berdych today if federer hits his recent heights. however, perhaps men?s quarter-finals day taught us to expect the unexpected.updated

Ankush Verma,14 Jul 2017,islam's 3rd holiest site shut 1st time in 17 yrs post attack,www.theguardian.com,"islam's third holiest site, the al-aqsa mosque in jerusalem, will be closed for friday prayers for the first time in 17 years. this comes after three attackers killed two israeli police officers near the mosque complex earlier in the day. all the three gunmen were killed and the area was cleared of visitors and closed, police officials said.","two israeli police officers have been shot dead and three gunmen killed during an early-morning shootout in one of jerusalem?s most holy and sensitive sites.the attack ? involving three israeli citizens of palestinian origin ? took place just after 7am in the temple mount/haram al-sharif complex in jerusalem. it began near the lions? gate entrance to the compound, which is revered as a holy site by both muslims and jews.a few hours after the incident, the chief of the israeli police, roni alsheich, confirmed the death of the two male officers from wounds sustained in the attack.the incident was among the most serious in jerusalem in recent years and threatened to raise israeli-palestinian tensions. the two dead police officers were named as hael sathawi, 30, and kamil shnan, 22.according to police, the three men ? residents of the israeli arab town of umm al-fahm who were armed with home-made carlo machine guns and a pistol ? opened fire on police near the gate before fleeing back into the heart of the compound which houses the al-aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock.israel?s shin bet security service later named the three attackers as mohammed ahmed mohammed jabareen, 29, mohammed hamed abd al-latif jabareen, 19, and mohammed ahmed mafdal jabareen, also 19, noting that none had previous security convictions.police security camera footage, released late on friday, showed the gunmen approaching two policemen at the gate from within the compound - raising questions about how their weapons were smuggled onto the site.two men with guns can be seen emerging through the low arched entrance and almost immediately shooting one of the policemen from behind as he is talking to his seated colleague.as other israeli police pursued the men, a heavy exchange of gunfire took place, startling early-morning worshippers in the central plaza, some of whom recorded the shootout on camera phones.in the immediate aftermath the compound was cleared of visitors and closed, with police announcing that muslim friday prayers, usually attended by thousands, would be cancelled for the first time in 17 years.israel said the site would remain closed until sunday at the earliest while it continued with security assessments despite calls for it to be reopened.the palestinian president, mahmoud abbas, condemned the attack in a rare phone call to the israeli president, benjamin netanyahu, according to the palestinian wafa news agency.video footage recorded during the attack showed shooting and police running across the central plaza in pursuit of the attackers.at one point, one of the gunmen, who is seen lying on the ground apparently motionless, is seen jumping up, amid a fresh exchange of fire in which he falls.a police spokesman described the beginning of the incident.?when they saw policemen they shot towards them and then escaped towards one of the mosques in the temple mount compound,? said luba samri. ?a chase ensued and the three terrorists were killed by police.?named after a swedish submachine gun of the 1940s, the 'carl gustav' or 'carlo' is the palestinian nickname for crude automatic weapons produced in small workshops in the occupied territories.designs and materials vary. a gun used in one recent attack had a barrel made from water piping while the moving parts are often mounted on already available stocks, including from paintball guns.while unreliable and inaccurate, the guns are much cheaper than black market weapons and israel is increasing its efforts to find and close the workshops where they are made.the al-aqsa mosque is islam?s third-holiest site, while the seventh-century dome of the rock is also revered by jews as the site of the historic temple. jews are permitted to visit the site but not pray there, a prohibition supported by the mainstream jewish halakhic tradition. it is managed under a longstanding arrangement with the jordanian-supported islamic institution known as the waqf.the last time the complex was closed off to muslims was after the 2014 shooting of jewish prayer rights activist yehuda glick, now a knesset member for the likud, while the last time friday prayers were cancelled was in 1990. netanyahu said in the aftermath of the attack that he would not change prayer rights at the site, despite calls by far-right politicians who sought to exploit the shooting.the deputy defence minister, eli ben-dahan of the far-right jewish home party, had called for israel to ?bolster its rule and control over the [holy sites], and to ensure that all jews can pray there at any time in safety?. a second jewish home mp, moti yogev, said the compound should be ?closed to muslim [worshippers] for a long time?.netanyahu rejected the calls. ?it was decided to shut the temple mount today for security reasons. searches will be carried out to ensure there are no more weapons at the [site]. the status quo on the temple mount will be preserved,? he said.the grand mufti of jerusalem, sheikh muhammad hussein, told palestinian news agencies he had been prevented from entering the complex. ?we insist on reaching al-aqsa mosque and performing prayers there. the occupation preventing us from praying marks an assault against our right to worship in this pure islamic mosque,? he said.the incident follows a reported move by the israeli government to allow israeli mps, who are not allowed to go to the flashpoint site, to visit the temple mount on a trial basis.israel?s public security minister, gilad erdan, said: ?the terror attack today is a severe and dire event in which all red lines have been crossed. the attack is still under investigation and will force us to look into existing security arrangements at temple mount and in its vicinity.?i call on all public figures to do all in their power to calm the situation and keep the peace.?a wave of palestinian street attacks that began in 2015 has slowed but not stopped. since september 2015, palestinian attackers have killed 43 israelis, two visiting americans and a british tourist.in that time, israeli forces have killed more than 254 palestinians, most of them said by israel to be attackers.",SUBJECTIVE,0.5259614586830139

case. the team said they had been asked to go to the embassy in kabul on thursday. ?we are so happy i can?t find words for it,? rodaba noori, 15, said from the runway as the girls were about to board a plane from their home city, herat, to the afghan capital.?we will stay in the united states for about seven days. we will compare the cultures between the us and afghanistan, and go sightseeing and talk to the people,? she said, in english. in an interview before the reversal, the girls had expressed their shock at the rejection. ?we thought the us and afghanistan had friendly relations. we thought the us?s fight for women?s rights and equality would get us visas,? noori said.yet since it took international outrage to sway the us visa decision, the u-turn will not assuage confusion in afghanistan over washington?s future commitments. human rights watch called the visa denial ?all too emblematic of the hollowness of us efforts to empower girls in afghanistan?.successive american governments have heralded women?s rights as a key reason for us forces? continued stay in afghanistan, and a cornerstone of us aid to the country is the five-year promote programme, which states: ?everyone who cares about the future of afghanistan supports women?s empowerment as the foundation for economic growth, peace and security.?only teams from afghanistan and the gambia were denied visas for the competition, neither of which is among the six muslim-majority countries subjected to donald trump?s travel ban.afghans often struggle to get us visas. in may, only 112 afghan applicants received the b1/b2 visa to the us that the girls applied for. in the same period the us granted the same visa to 1,091 applicants from iran and 274 from sudan, which are now subject to trump?s travel ban after the us supreme court partially reinstated it.when told that a team from iran had received visas, the girls could not contain their laughter. ?why is it only afghans who can?t go? it?s discrimination. it really makes me angry,? said lida azizi, 16.the us embassy in kabul did not disclose why it rejected the robotics competition team. however, given the process, the most likely cause was a suspicion that the girls intended to migrate.asked whether they would return to afghanistan after their us trip, the girls ? aged 14 to 16 ? seemed baffled. ?of course we will. we have our studies, our families, our classmates, our entire lives here,? said azizi. ?we don?t have any relatives in the us. we only want to go for the competition.?if they make it on time, the girls will watch their ball-sorting robot compete against teams from 156 other countries in the first global challenge.from the beginning, the afghan girls were at a disadvantage. in the male-dominated field of technology, the team?s sponsor wanted an all-female team to represent afghanistan. but only six of the top 15 girls who emerged got permission from their families to compete.the next hurdle was afghan customs which, apparently confused by the package sent by the organisers, held the equipment for three and a half months, leaving the girls with only two weeks to build the robot. ?the organisers said, ?you can?t do this?,? said alireza mehraban, the team?s mentor. to finish on time, the girls worked over the fasting month of ramadan. ?we were tired but we came here, even during eid,? said kawsar roshan. she said the team wanted to show the world how far afghan girls had come during a western intervention that began before most of them were born.?since i was a child, i wanted to show that girls can do anything, also outside the home,? kawsar said.to apply for visas, the team twice travelled to kabul, despite a recent spike in violence in the capital.two days before their second embassy appointment, a truck bomb killed 150 people in kabul?s diplomatic quarter. the day they arrived, anti-government protests had the city in lockdown. the girls had to walk to the us embassy, where they received their rejection.?they cried for six hours,? said mehraban, the mentor. fatemah qaderyan said she cried so much she couldn?t leave her relatives? house in kabul and missed her return flight.for roya mahboob, the chief executive of the digital citizen fund, which sponsors the team, allowing the girls to compete sends an important signal. ?the feeling to not be ignored or be equal as boys if the opportunity is available to you is important,?

and ?one word says it all. asian?.this is the first time an airbnb host has been penalized for racial discrimination under a landmark agreement between the san francisco-headquartered accommodation marketplace and the california department of fair employment and housing (dfeh), announced earlier this year. the agreement allows the regulator to test and penalize airbnb hosts for racial bias. in addition to paying monetary damages and taking a college-level course in asian american studies, barker must agree to comply with anti-discrimination laws, make a personal apology to suh, participate in a community education panel and volunteer with a civil rights organization.?we were thinking pretty creatively with this agreement,? said kevin kish, director of dfeh. ?the law tends to be backwards-looking, focusing on compensating people for harm. we?re interested in remedies that repair harm and transform relationships.?suh booked barker?s place for a long weekend with her fiance in february 2017 a month in advance for $250 a night. when suh later asked if it was ok to bring two friends and two dogs along, barker said it was fine but the group would need to pay an additional $50 a night, according to screenshots of their text messages. on the day of the booking, the foursome drove for hours in the rain and snow to big bear. minutes away from the house, suh texted barker to let them know they were close and to confirm the cost of the stay. according to suh, barker then denied she ever agreed to having two extra guests and canceled the reservation, despite suh sending her screenshots of their earlier agreement.when suh said she?d complain to airbnb about the racist remark, barker replied: ?it?s why we have trump ? and i will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreigners.?in an emotional video immediately after the incident, suh said: ?i just feel so hurt. people thought: ?oh, with the election of president obama racism is over in this country.? no, it?s very much alive, it exists and it could happen to anyone.??it stings that after living in the us for over 23 years this is what happens. no matter if i follow the law ... no matter how well i treat others, it doesn?t matter. if you?re asian, you?re less than human and people can treat you like trash.?after suh complained, airbnb carried out its own investigation and banned barker from the platform.suh also complained to dfeh, leading to a separate investigation, mediation and an agreement between the two parties, negotiated last week. the idea of making the host attend the asian american studies course came out during mediation sessions. ?a lot of times when we see bias incidents it involves a lack of understanding of the experiences and histories of a particular group of people,? kish said. ?this was a creative way to address that core underlying cause of the bias.??we want there to be strong anti-discrimination protections and preventions of harm, but we recognize that the world isn?t divided into good guys and bad guys. humans have biases and we also need to recognize that humans change.?barker?s lawyer edward lee said in a statement that his client was ?regretful for her impetuous actions and comments? but pleased to have resolved the matter with suh and the dfeh ?in a manner that can hopefully bring a positive outcome out of an unfortunate incident?.airbnb allowed the dfeh to regulate it for racial bias following a 10-month investigation based on a growing number of reports suggesting hosts regularly refuse to rent to guests due to their race, a problem exposed in 2016 under the hashtag #airbnbwhileblack.until that point, airbnb, like other ?sharing economy? companies including uber and instacart, had repeatedly resisted industry regulations, arguing that it was a ?platform? and not subject to local laws and requirements that apply to similar businesses. under the agreement, airbnb allows the government to test for racial discrimination by hosts in california who have been subject to discrimination complaints and have three or more listings. the ?fair housing testing? echoes the process dfeh investigators have used in the traditional rental market where black and white applicants, with otherwise identical backgrounds, are both sent to try and secure a lease from a landlord. with airbnb, investigators can set up fake accounts and make reservation requests to hosts to see if they are discriminating. kish hopes that this first case will send a message to hosts: ?we?re watching,?

Aarushi Maheshwari,13 Jul 2017,canadian fisherman killed by whale moments after rescuing it,www.theguardian.com,"a canadian lobster fisherman died after getting struck by a north atlantic right whale, moments after rescuing it on monday. joe howlett had saved roughly two dozen whales in fifteen years, after they became tangled in fishing nets. the fisheries department said, ""taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals.""","a canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed ? moments after a last successful rescue.joe howlett, from campobello island, new brunswick, boarded a vessel off the province?s eastern coast on monday to help rescue a north atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. the rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the gulf of st lawrence, off canada. with a global population believed to be around 525, the string of deaths suggests that more than 1% of the population has died in recent weeks. howlett helped free the whale ? only to be struck by the mammal moments later, said mackie green of the campobello whale rescue team. ?they got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,? green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the canadian press.howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free. just a few days before his death, howlett had helped liberate another north atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. ?joe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,? said green, who joined forces with howlett to launch the whale rescue in 2002. ?this is something he loved and there?s no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and i know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.?on tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an ?irreplaceable member of the whale rescue community?.in a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two. ?taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals,? it noted. ?there are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.?howlett?s death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north atlantic right whales in the past month. a team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales ? which live along the eastern seaboard of canada and the us and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length ? are dying in large numbers. last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. while their findings are still preliminary and don?t explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks.",NEUTRAL,0.8209927082061768

(loose hijab) is not a crime under iranian law. saeid montazeralmahdi, a spokesperson for the iranian police, disagreed. ?what is visible to the public eye is not private space and norms and the rules should be respected within cars.? he also warned car owners against using tinted glass to prevent onlookers from seeing into the car. the debate is not only among liberal iranians. abolfazl najafi tehrani, a cleric based in tehran, tweeted: ?people?s cars, like people?s houses, are their property and a private space and infringing upon this space will disturb people?s moral security and will harm women?s trust with the police.?yahya kamalpour, a member of the iranian parliament, said: ?the space within people?s cars is a private space and the police has no right to enter that space without a judicial order.?the debate comes amid a growing rift between the government and the hardline judiciary that acts independently of rouhani?s government. despite restrictions, women are increasingly active in iranian society. it emerged on sunday that iran air, the country?s national airline, has for the first time appointed a female ceo. rouhani is also under pressure from his voter base to nominate a record number of female ministers in his cabinet reshuffle next month. in a sign of slowly changing attitudes, ali karimi, a veteran iranian footballer, on monday called on the authorities to allow female fans to attend stadiums alongside men.

who had damaging information about hillary clinton.veselnitskaya is a defence lawyer based just outside moscow, whose main client in recent years has been denis katsyv, a businessman accused of profiting from a major tax fraud uncovered by lawyer sergei magnitsky. she fought his case in us courts and mounted a pr campaign to try to clear katsyv?s name and overturn the ?magnitsky act? sanctions against russian officials that followed.veselnitskaya is not a government official and portrays herself as a lawyer with a private client. the question, then, is how she was able to secure the meeting at trump tower during a presidential campaign and why she was introduced to trump jr as representing the russian government.trump jr agrees, adding that he would probably be accompanied by ?paul manafort (campaign boss)? and ?my brother-in-law,? jared kushner, husband of trump?s daughter ivanka and now a senior white house adviser.the formatting of the emails suggests that trump jr forwarded the whole chain to manafort and kushner before the meeting the three attended with veselnitskaya at trump tower in new york on 9 june.on sunday, trump jr had said he had asked manafort and kushner to attend but not told them what the meeting was about. an associate of manafort said on tuesday that the former campaign chairman claims not to have read to the bottom of the chain of emails forwarded to him and kushner by trump jr about the meeting. jamie gorelick, an attorney for jared kushner, did not respond to questions about whether kushner read the emails and why he attended the meeting.critics seized on the new disclosures to question why three of trump?s closest advisers were willing to accept such a meeting instead of alerting authorities to interference by a foreign adversary. special counsel robert mueller and the house and senate intelligence committees are investigating russian meddling in the election, thought to include stealing democratic national committee emails and the use of social-media bots to spread fake news about clinton.my son is a high-quality person and i applaud his transparency.trump jr has offered shifting explanations for the meeting in recent days. in an interview broadcast on conservative fox news on tuesday night, he again sought to justify his motives but conceded that he could have handled the situation better.?in retrospect i probably would have done things a little differently,?

was meant to mean veselnitskaya. ?it?s a language thing,? he said. he referred questions from the guardian to his lawyer.trump jr has given varying reasons for why he accepted the meeting, first claiming it was to discuss american adoptions of russian children, then acknowledging that he was interested in information about clinton.the president?s eldest son denies any wrongdoing and tweeted on tuesday: ?media and dems are extremely invested in the russia story. if this nonsense meeting is all they have after a year, i understand the desperation!?goldstone told the associated press on monday he set up the meeting on behalf of a client, pop star emin agalarov, the son of a moscow-based developer, aras agalarov, who has close ties to putin and tried to partner with trump in a hotel project.aras agalarov worked with donald trump to bring the miss universe contest to moscow in 2013. trump appeared in a music video with emin agalarov that featured several miss universe contestants.goldstone?s 3 june email says the russian government?s support for trump is ?helped along by aras and emin?. he asks if trump jr wants to speak to emin about it directly and proposes: ?i can also send this info to your father via rhona? ? presumably rhona graff, donald trump?s longtime executive assistant ? ?but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.? it is not clear from the emails whether goldstone did send any of the information to trump sr, who has denied all knowledge of the meeting through his lawyer. before the publication of trump jr?s emails, veselnitskaya had denied she had gone to the meeting with information about the clinton campaign. ?it?s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information, they wanted it so badly,? she told nbc, denying that she had any to offer. she also answered ?no? when asked if she had ever worked for the russian government.later, sergey kislyak, the russian ambassador to the us, dismissed the significance of the trump jr meeting. ?i don?t think anything about it and to be honest there are more serious things to be think about in relation to russia,? he told the guardian at a us-russia business council farewell reception in washington.trump jr was at trump tower in new york on tuesday, according to a police officer at the building.eric trump, donald jr?s brother, was spotted in the lobby at around 1.30pm with his wife lara. asked by the guardian if he had any comment on his brother?s emails or knew goldstone himself, eric trump did not respond. he then headed quickly to a gold elevator and headed upwards, staring silently ahead.the revelations around 39-year-old trump jr?s involvement is one of the biggest blows yet in the saga of the trump campaign?s alleged ties to russia, which the president has dismissed as a ?hoax?.republicans on capitol hill were taken aback but reluctant to weigh in just yet. at least two republicans on the senate intelligence committee, senators john cornyn and james lankford, said trump jr should testify before the panel, which is overseeing one of three parallel investigations into russian interference in the us election.john mccain, a frequent critic of the trump administration, said there were ?many allusions and many stories of meetings and communications?, while noting he expected there was more yet to come.richard burr, the republican chief of the senate intelligence committee, said it was ?too early to draw any conclusions?.burr?s democratic counterpart, mark warner, said it was significant that the emails had been forwarded to kushner and manafort.?they?ve got a lot of explaining to do, because all these denials of any knowledge of russian government involvement seems to be a gross contradiction here,?

Vani Vivek,11 Jul 2017,uk radio station hacked to play song on masturbation,www.theguardian.com,hackers hijacked the airwaves of a uk radio station to play a song about masturbation at least eight times in the last month. 'the winker's song' was originally released in the 1970's and uses the word 'wanker' 36 times. the hackers have reportedly been using a transmitter to play the song on the same frequency as the station.,"the communications regulator is hunting a radio pirate who has repeatedly hijacked the airwaves of a local station with a deliberately offensive song about masturbation.the winker?s song, a 1970s ditty by an artist going by the name ivor biggun, has been illegally forced on to the output of mansfield 103.2 at least eight times in the last month.ofcom said it was taking the incident ?extremely seriously? and its engineers were working closely with the radio station to trace and identify the pirate.listeners were last subjected to the song, which uses the word ?wanker? 36 times, this weekend during a live family broadcast from mansfield?s party in the market event.it is believed the rogue broadcaster could be using a small transmitter to play the adult theme on the same frequency, overriding the station?s scheduled programming. tony delahunty, managing director of mansfield 103.2, said: ?some people have told me that their children have started humming the song in the car. ?we have had calls from people who have found it hilarious, while some have raised their concerns, including our competitors, and a lot of people in the industry are aghast at how difficult it is to stop these people.?speaking to bbc radio 4?s today programme, he added: ?there?s is absolutely nothing we could do about it and we?re trying very hard to do something about it.?we are told by ofcom who are investigating the matter, that you only need, and this is the frightening thing, a small transmitter and if you can get near where there is an outside broadcast or a signal and you can overpower that signal [and] you?re on the airwaves.?he claimed the incidents raised the potential for a more serious hijacking of a radio station. ?this is a clown but it exposes a situation that is available for, who knows a terrorist, that type of person, some idiot who wants to put emergency messages on. it could become an awful lot worse. the big problem is you can?t catch them ??i want it to stop, because it could be inflicting a very nasty message to very young kids and their parents could be annoyed.?ofcom said maliciously causing radio interference was a criminal offence carrying a potential sentence of two years in prison and an unlimited fine.but a spokesman said ?it doesn?t happen that often? and requires specialist knowledge and equipment. ?you need quite a high-powered transmitter to be able to go over the levels that the station is broadcasting at to interrupt their frequencies.ofcom stressed that it is not as easy to hack a radio station as delahunty suggested he added: ?we have a spectrum enforcement team who look after our airwaves and make sure they are kept free from interference, whether it is deliberate or accidental, and we have strong enforcement powers.if radio stations broadcast content that is deemed harmful or offensive, under the digital economy act they can be suspended. last week ofcom suspended sheffield based imam fm after it broadcast lectures from a former terrorist leader.",SUBJECTIVE,0.6486948132514954
Gaurav Shroff,11 Jul 2017,only 100 firms account for 71% of global emissions: study,www.theguardian.com,"just 100 companies have been the source of 71% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a carbon majors report. the report further claims that half of the emissions were traced to 25 state-owned fossil fuel producers. if the current fossil fuel extraction trend continues, global average temperatures would rise by 4ºc by 2100, the report warns.","just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world?s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.the carbon majors report (pdf) ?pinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions,? says pedro faria, technical director at environmental non-profit cdp, which published the report in collaboration with the climate accountability institute. traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change. the report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 ? the year the intergovernmental panel on climate change was established ? can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. the scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report. exxonmobil, shell, bp and chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. if fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4c by the end of the century. this is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.while companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says faria, the barrier is the ?absolute tension? between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.a carbon tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables ? in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.cdp says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. a fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. ?that puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,? says faria.investors should move out of fossil fuels, says michael brune, executive director of us environmental organisation the sierra club. ?not only is it morally risky, it?s economically risky. the world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.?there is a ?growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,? says brune. nearly 100 companies including apple, facebook, google and ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the re100 initiative. volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. and oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. shell set up a renewables arm in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for chevron says it?s ?committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions? and is investing in two of the world?s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. a bp spokesperson says its ?determined to be part of the solution? for climate change and is ?investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.? and exxonmobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage.but for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. a research paper published last year by paul stevens, an academic at think tank chatham house, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a ?nasty, brutish and short? end within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. investors now have a choice, according to charlie kronick, senior programme advisor at greenpeace uk. ?the future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops??",SUBJECTIVE,0.6766191124916077

""the challenges encountered in phasing out large currency notes and replacing them with new ones may pose risks to the pace of other economic reforms (eg goods and services tax, labour, and land reforms),"" it said.","the world bank has downgraded the indian economy?s growth forecast as sharp falls in the country?s automobile and real estate sales flagged the short-term impact of recalling india?s two most-used bank notes. the washington-based financial institution predicted india?s economy would grow by a ?still robust? 7% in the fiscal year to march 2017 ? a 0.6% drop from its earlier forecast but still the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.it attributes the fall to november?s decision to recall all 1,000 and 500 rupee currency bills from circulation, a surprise demonetisation move intended to weed out untaxed wealth, hasten the digitisation of india?s economy and disrupt terrorist and other criminal networks. ?continued tailwinds from low oil prices and solid agricultural output [were] partly offset by challenges associated with the withdrawal of a large volume of currency in circulation and subsequent replacement with new notes,? the world bank said on wednesday.demonetisation has suffocated the vast informal economy, which employs up to 80% of indians, but the world bank said the impact of the policy was likely to be short term. ?india is expected to regain its momentum, with growth rising to 7.6% in fiscal year 2018-19 and strengthening to 7.8% in fiscal year 2019-20,? the bank said.automobile industry data also released on wednesday showed the largest fall in sales in 16 years. nearly 300,000 fewer vehicle were purchased last month than in december 2015, a drop of 19%, according to the society of indian automobile manufacturers.sales of two-wheelers ? which require less paperwork to buy and are more popular in rural areas, so are more likely to be bought in cash ? fell by 22%, the steepest rate since siam began collecting data in 1997.property sales also came to a complete standstill, according to a report by property consultants knight frank india. sales fell by 44% across eight major indian cities between october and december 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, the report said.delhi was particularly badly hit, with sales in the capital slumping by more than 50%, and 73% fewer new residential developments being launched than in the last quarter of 2015. ?the effect of demonetisation on all segments of the real estate sector across all markets has been fairly brutal to say the least,? said shishir baijal, the chairman of knight frank india.speaking at the vibrant gujarat summit on wednesday, the indian finance minister, arun jaitley, continued to defend demonetisation, linking the policy to the goods and services tax the government is aiming to introduce in april. ?the combination of a more digitised economy with a more efficient tax system ... will make our economy look much cleaner and bigger,? he said.jaitley said the rupee recall was ?a major step toward integration of [the] informal economy with the more formal economy?. he said: ?this itself is going to increase the transactions which are covered within the banking system, transactions which may lead to higher [tax] revenue in the future.?",NEUTRAL,0.5937355756759644

in a press conference, angela merkel said world leaders have agreed their final communique at the g20 summit.she said 19 members of the group of 20 have reaffirmed the paris climate accord as ?irreversible.?she made clear that it had been very difficult to get a consensus and in the end, breaking from tradition, a separate paragraph was included to cover the position of the us, who are withdrawing from the paris climate change agreement and wanted fossil fuels to be mentioned. the german chancellor said the declaration makes absolutely clear that is not the common position of the other 19 world leaders. merkel said there had been no compromise on climate change and called the us position ?regrettable?.she said: ?we amended the declaration and it says very clearly what the united states of america want and underneath what the other countries want.?the german chancellor said she ?deplored? the decision by the us to withdraw from the paris climate change agreement, but said that all other nations agree paris climate accord is irreversible.here is the controversial section of the g20 communique:we take note of the decision of the united states of america to withdraw from the paris agreement. the united states of america announced it will immediately cease the implementation of its current nationally-determined contribution and affirms its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs. the united states of america states it will endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in their nationally determined contributions. directly following that paragraph is this one, as merkel said in her press conference:the leaders of the other g20 members state that the paris agreement is irreversible. we reiterate the importance of fulfilling the unfccc commitment by developed countries in providing means of implementation including financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation actions in line with paris outcomes and note the oecd?s report ?investing in climate, investing in growth?. we reaffirm our strong commitment to the paris agreement, moving swiftly towards its full implementation in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances and, to this end, we agree to the g20 hamburg climate and energy action plan for growth as set out in the annex. read the whole declaration here. updated

trump has promised $639 million in funding for humanitarian programmes, including $331 million to help feed starving people in four famine-hit countries - somalia, south sudan, nigeria and yemen. the us president?s pledge came during a working session of the g20 summit of world leaders in hamburg, providing a ?godsend? to the un world food programme, the group?s executive director, david beasley, told reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.?we?re facing the worst humanitarian crisis since world war two,? said beasley, a republican and former south carolina governor who was nominated by trump to head the world?s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide. he said the additional funding was about a third of what the agency estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries facing famine and in other areas. the wfp estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst affected zones stemming from wars and ?man-made? crises, beasley said. ?we estimated that if we didn?t receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,? he said. trump?s announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the us state department and other humanitarian missions as part of his ?america first? policy. beasley said the agency had worked hard with the white house and the u.s. government to secure the funding, but trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. a wpf spokesman said germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief.the united states has long been the largest donor to the wfp.",NEUTRAL,0.8501139283180237

Yash Kumar,09 Dec 2016,lawyer slams julian assange over statement on rape case,www.theguardian.com,"a lawyer acting for the woman who made rape allegations against wikileaks founder julian assange has accused him of ""violating"" her client in the media. this comes after assange released a public statement giving details of his relationship with the rape accuser. assange said he released the statement because he wanted people to know ""how abusive"" the process has been.","a lawyer acting for the woman who made rape allegations against julian assange has accused him of ?violating? her client in the media, after the wikileaks founder released a statement detailing answers he gave to swedish investigators.assange on wednesday thumbed his nose at swedish officials, who he says have robbed him of his freedom for six years, by releasing the answers he gave to them under questioning at ecuador?s london embassy last month.the statement sets out for the first time a detailed account by assange of his encounter with the woman in august 2010.elisabeth massi fritz, the lawyer for the accuser, said assange?s decision to release details of their relationship in the statement was ?unfortunate?.she later accused assange of ?violating? her client in the media. ?assange seems to be desperate. as soon as he has something to say he calls the media and is conducting the investigation through the media,? she told the swedish broadcaster svt.?the only thing i can say is that assange has low credibility, which we will prove when we prosecute. i expect the prosecutor to issue charges. i also expect assange to stop violating my client in the media. she has suffered more than enough for six years.?the transcript of a police interview with the woman was leaked to the media in december 2010, which the australian, who has not been charged with any crime, says helped to establish an aura of guilt around him.since then, assange has repeatedly asked to be allowed to tell his side of the story to prosecutors, but until recently they insisted he come to sweden for questioning. assange has been confined to ecuador?s london embassy since june 2012 after claiming asylum to avoid extradition over the allegations.?i am now releasing my statement to the public,? assange said in a letter accompanying the document on wednesday. ?the reason is simple. i want people to know the truth about how abusive this process has been.?the release of the statement was expected to prompt dismay in sweden, where prosecutors? desire for personal aspects of the case to remain confidential has led them to deny assange access to evidence against him because of the risk that it might become public.in correspondence with ecuador over the conditions of assange?s interrogation, the swedish prosecutor in the case, marianne ny, insisted the proceedings remain private to protect the plaintiff. a spokesperson for ny told the guardian she was awaiting the formal report on the interviews from ecuador, due this month, before deciding on her next step.the statement, which assange read out to investigators in response to their questioning, contains a sustained attack on the prosecutor, for whom he claims the interview in london was ?simply a ruse to tick a box to ensure the technical possibility to indict me?. under swedish law, an interview with the suspect is an essential step before issuing charges.the statement fleshes out assange?s argument that he is at risk of extradition from sweden to the us to face espionage charges ? and potentially a life behind bars.last week the un?s working group on arbitrary detention rejected an appeal by the uk against its february ruling that the risks facing assange if he left the embassy meant his situation amounted to a prolonged deprivation of liberty ?in breach of the principles of reasonableness, necessity and proportionality?.until now, assange has not described his sexual encounter with his accuser. he has not publicly apologised to her or tried to mitigate the distress she says she has been caused.assange?s statement says that, owing to us hostility towards wikileaks, his bank cards were blocked after his arrival in sweden in the summer of 2010 at the peak of the pentagon?s conflict with him over the release of a trove of diplomatic and military documents. he says this made him highly dependent on the hospitality of others.the woman ?appeared to be sympathetic to my plight and also appeared to be romantically interested in me?, assange told prosecutors. ?she was not close to people i was close to, so it seemed that those who meant me harm would be unlikely to try to find me by monitoring her movements.?she ?made it very clear that she wanted to have sexual intercourse? with assange and placed his hands on her breasts while in a cinema, he continued. ?i felt concerned about the intensity of [her] interest and i also deeply loved another woman, which played on my mind and left me emotionally distracted.?the intensity of her interest made him fear how she might react if she felt he was rejecting her, he said. he claimed he later discovered she had collected dozens of photos of him in the weeks before they met, her flickr photo account filled with ?pages and pages? of photos of assange.after they had unprotected sex, she wanted him to have a test for sexually transmitted diseases, the statement continues.?we were in agreement and arranged to meet the following day in the nearby park around lunchtime, when i would have time to get tested. she said she was fine and seemed at ease. you can imagine my disbelief when i woke the next morning to the news that i had been arrested in my absence for ?rape? and that police were ?hunting? all over stockholm for me.?assange claims that text messages sent by the woman at the time ? access to which his lawyers were allowed only briefly and early in the case ? show she was not asleep during the sex.according to the transcripts leaked to the guardian in 2010, the woman told police she met assange at a seminar at which he was speaking, and afterwards went to the cinema with him, where they kissed in the back row.two days later, she arranged to meet him and they went to her flat. they started to have sex, she said, but she moved away because assange had not wanted to wear a condom, and he fell asleep. she told police they later had sex at least once when he had ?unwillingly? worn a condom, but the following morning, after she had gone to buy breakfast and then climbed back into bed and fallen asleep, she had woken to find him having sex with her without a condom.according to the statement, she told him: ?you better not have hiv,? and he answered: ?of course not,? but ?she couldn?t be bothered to tell him one more time because she had been going on about the condom all night. she had never had unprotected sex before.? the statement says she bought the morning-after pill and took an std test but when she telephoned assange asking him to be tested he said he didn?t have the time.assange has made no secret of his contempt for the swedish prosecutor, but his decision to release his side of the story appears calculated to place further pressure on ny to end the stalemate in the case, either by issuing a rape charge ? and implicitly explaining the evidence for the charge ? or lifting the arrest warrant against him.?in the past the prosecution has fed partial information to tabloids that politically oppose me,? assange said. ?it is better that my statement, which i am happy with, and which makes it obvious to all that i am innocent, sees the light in full.?",NEUTRAL,0.5421594381332397

janette wipper, a dol regional director, testified in court in san francisco on friday.reached for comment friday afternoon, janet herold, regional solicitor for the dol, said: ?the investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at google headquarters.?herold added: ?the government?s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in google is quite extreme, even in this industry.?google strongly denied the accusations of inequities, claiming it did not have a gender pay gap.the explosive allegation against one of the largest and most powerful companies in silicon valley comes at a time when the male-dominated tech industry is facing increased scrutiny over gender discrimination, pay disparities and sexual harassment. the allegations emerged at a hearing in federal court as part of a lawsuit the dol filed against google in january, seeking to compel the company to provide salary data and documents to the government.google is a federal contractor, which means it is required to allow the dol to inspect and copy records and information about its its compliance with equal opportunity laws. last year, the department?s office of federal contract compliance programs requested job and salary history for google employees, along with names and contact information, as part of the compliance review.google, however, repeatedly refused to hand over the data, which was a violation of its contractual obligations with the federal government, according to the dol?s lawsuit. after the suit was originally filed, a company spokesperson claimed that google had provided ?hundreds of thousands of records? to the government and that the requests outlined in the complaint were ?overbroad?, revealed confidential information, or violated employees? privacy. labor officials detailed the government?s discrimination claims against google at the friday hearing while making the case for why the company should be forced to comply with the dol?s requests for documents. wipper said the department found pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and said officials needed earlier compensation data to evaluate the root of the problem and needed to be able to confidentially interview employees. ?we want to understand what?s causing the disparity,? she said. lisa barnett sween, one of google?s attorneys, testified in opening remarks that the dol?s request constituted a ?fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review?. she said the request was an unconstitutional violation of the company?s fourth amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches.marc pilotin, a dol attorney, said: ?for some reason or another, google wants to hide the pay-related information.?in a statement to the guardian, google said: ?we vehemently disagree with [wipper?s] claim. every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the dol hasn?t provided any data, or shared its methodology.?the company has recently claimed that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and provides equal pay across races in the us. herold told the guardian that the department ?seeks additional information to ensure the accuracy of the department?s findings, because if the findings are confirmed, this is a troubling situation?.google is not the first tech company to face legal action from the labor department over employment practices. in september, the dol filed a lawsuit against palantir, the palo alto data analytics company, alleging it systematically discriminated against asian job applicants in its hiring process. palantir has argued that the dol?s analysis was flawed and the company has denied the accusations.in january, the department sued oracle, another large tech company, claiming it paid white men more than others, leading to pay discrimination against women and black and asian employees. oracle claimed the case was ?politically motivated? and said its employment decisions were based on merit and experience.in recent months, there has been uncertainty about the future of these kinds of aggressive dol enforcement efforts under donald trump. the president has rolled back obama-era protections for female workers, and some dol staffers have raised concerns that the new administration will not embrace the agency?s core mission of supporting workers? rights. an oracle executive also joined trump?s transition team, and the president?s close adviser peter thiel co-founded palantir. in the google case, the labor department?s lawyers have asked the court to cancel all of the company?s federal contracts and block any future business with the government if it continues to refuse to comply with the audit.google began releasing diversity statistics in 2014 and reported last year that women made up 31% of its overall workforce and that only 2% of workers were black and 3% latino. white employees accounted for 59% of the us workforce and asians made up 32%.contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com",SUBJECTIVE,0.5189030766487122

Dishant Sharma,03 Aug 2017,human embryos edited to stop deadly disease for the 1st time,www.theguardian.com,"scientists, for the first time, successfully freed embryos of a piece of faulty dna that causes a fatal heart disease to run in families. the disease, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, causes the heart to stop suddenly and is the result of an error in a single gene. the breakthrough could lead to preventing 10,000 disorders that are passed down the generations.","scientists have modified human embryos to remove genetic mutations that cause heart failure in otherwise healthy young people in a landmark demonstration of the controversial procedure.it is the first time that human embryos have had their genomes edited outside china, where researchers have performed a handful of small studies to see whether the approach could prevent inherited diseases from being passed on from one generation to the next.while none of the research so far has created babies from modified embryos, a move that would be illegal in many countries, the work represents a milestone in scientists? efforts to master the technique and brings the prospect of human clinical trials one step closer.the work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer.?this embryo gene correction method, if proven safe, can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations,? said paula amato, a fertility specialist involved in the us-korean study at oregon health and science university.the scientists used a powerful gene editing tool called crispr-cas9 to fix mutations in embryos made with the sperm of a man who inherited a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or hcm. the disease, which leads to a thickening of the heart?s muscular wall, affects one in 500 people and is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people.crispr, or to give it its full name, crispr-cas9, allows scientists to precisely target and edit pieces of the genome. crispr is a guide molecule made of rna, that allows a specific site of interest on the dna double helix to be targeted. the rna molecule is attached to cas9, a bacterial enzyme that works as a pair of ""molecular scissors"" to cut the dna at the exact point required. this allows scientists to cut, paste and delete single letters of genetic code. humans have two copies of every gene, but some diseases are caused by a mutation in only one of the copies. for the study, the scientists recruited a man who carried a single mutant copy of a gene called mybpc3 which causes hcm.when the scientists made embryos with the man?s sperm and healthy eggs from donors, they found that, as expected, about half of the embryos carried the mutant gene. if the affected embryos were implanted into women and carried to term, the resulting children would inherit the heart condition.writing in the journal nature, the researchers describe how gene editing dramatically reduced the number of embryos that carried the dangerous mutation. when performed early enough, at the same time as fertilisation, 42 out of 58 embryos, or 72%, were found to be free of the disease-causing mutation.the work has impressed other scientists in the field because in previous experiments, gene editing has worked only partially, mending harmful mutations in some cells, but not others. another problem happens when the wrong genes are modified by mistake, but in the latest work the scientists found no evidence of these so-called ?off target effects??they?ve got remarkably good results, it?s a big advance.? said richard hynes, a geneticist at mit who this year co-chaired a major report on human genome editing for the us national academy of sciences (nas). ?this brings it closer to clinic, but there?s still a lot of work to do.?today, people who carry certain genetic diseases can opt for ivf and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. the procedure can only help if there is a chance that some embryos will be healthy. according to shoukhrat mitalipov, who led the latest research, gene editing could bolster the number of healthy embryos available for doctors to implant.more work is needed to prove that gene editing would be safe to do in people, but even if it seems safe, scientists face major regulatory hurdles before clinical trials could start. in the us, congress has barred the food and drug administration from even considering human trials with edited embryos, while in the uk it is illegal to implant genetically modified embryos in women. the procedure is controversial because genetic modifications made to an embryo affect not only the child it becomes but future generations too. ?it?s still a long road ahead,? said mitalipov. ?it?s unclear when we?d be allowed to move on.?in the latest study, the mutation was corrected by a route that scientists have not seen before, with the cell copying healthy dna from the mother?s egg instead of the template. one question scientists need to explore now is whether mutations carried by eggs can be corrected as easily as those carried by sperm.?if all of this holds up for different genes and is also true when the mutation is inherited from the mother, it will be a major step forward,? said janet rossant, senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the hospital for sick children in toronto.asked about the potential for gene editing to produce designer babies, rossant, a co-author of the nas report on gene editing, said it was a distant prospect. ?we are still a long way from serious consideration of using gene editing to enhance traits in babies,? she said. ?we don?t understand the genetic basis of many of the human traits that might be targets for enhancement. even if we did, a genetic alteration that enhanced one trait could have unexpected negative consequences on other traits, and this would be an inherited feature for the next generation.??the nas report came out strongly against any form of gene editing designed to simply enhance human potential,?

particularly those who were there. bolton wanderers away; 30 april 2005. lampard surges around one opponent, cuts inside another and thrashes a low shot into the net.if chelsea win, they win the league title. for the first time since 1955. and in their centenary year, too. lampard has set them on their way and the celebrations that follow are frenzied. he is buried beneath a scrum of team-mates. even some of the substitutes jump on.lampard is not finished. on a quick break, he finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. he walks the ball around him to make it 2-0. game over. chelsea are the champions. lampard is a champion. not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.he was not finished. it was the second major honour of his career, following on from the league cup triumph in february of that year and lampard would go on to claim 11 of them ? all with his beloved chelsea, the club he joined from west ham united in 2001. the highlight, surely, was the champions league final in 2012, when he captained chelsea, in the absence of the suspended john terry, to the penalty shootout victory against bayern munich.now, lampard is finished. at the age of 38 and after 21 years in the professional game, he has decided to retire. he does so with three premier league titles to his name; four fa cups; two league cups; the champions league and the europa league. in other words, the clean sweep at club level.with england, it never went to plan, although he is hardly the only player who can say that. he was excellent at euro 2004, scoring three times as england reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the world cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last 16 against germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ? except that the officials ruled it as no goal. it would have made the score 2-2. instead, england slumped to a 4-1 defeat.in many respects, it summed up how lampard?s international career, which yielded 106 caps and 29 goals, came down on the wrong side of the margins. it was shaped by his relationship in central midfield with steven gerrard, or the lack of one. the lampard-gerrard conundrum was debated endlessly.nevertheless, lampard goes down as a premier league great and he owes it all to his phenomenal work ethic and mental toughness; the desire that he has always had to prove his worth ? and others wrong.?when frank was a youngster, i can remember a lot of people saying: ?what?s all the fuss? he?s a good player but he isn?t that good,? says tony carr, the former west ham academy director, under whom lampard developed. ?he never got to play for england schoolboys and i can remember harry redknapp, the west ham manager, asking me why frank wasn?t playing for england youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.?harry rang the england coach, who was dave burnside, and dave said: ?we know about him but we think we?ve got better.? that sort of thing was a fantastic spur for frank. with his bloody?mindedness, his dedication, the way he constantly tried to improve himself ? he made himself the ultimate pro. i?ve got nothing but complete admiration for him.?as the tributes came in on thursday, the one from terry stood out. lampard?s long-time chelsea team?mate described him as a gentleman and a leader. but terry also made reference to how lampard had wrung every last drop from his talent. ?you were the best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,? terry wrote. ?you stayed out [after training] working on your finishing ? 20 goals a year wasn?t good enough for you; you wanted 25, 30 goals. i will miss you getting four cones and doing sprints after training ? setting the example for the academy kids.?lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only ryan giggs and gareth barry have made more premier league appearances than his 609 while his run of 164 consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. he read the game with intelligence ? this is a man who recorded one of britain?s highest mensa scores ? and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.in the end, though, lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution. he says the two at bolton were his best with the one he scored for chelsea at aston villa in 2013, which took him past bobby tambling?s all-time record for the club, not far behind.when lampard left chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at manchester city and new york city, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them. it is doubtful whether the mark will be overhauled. in terms of the premier league, only alan shearer, wayne rooney and andy cole have scored more than his 177 goals and they, of course, are strikers.his numbers are mind?boggling and terry, tambling and others have described him as chelsea?s greatest player. his next move looks likely to be into coaching. whatever he does, lampard will give it his all.",SUBJECTIVE,0.9302253723144531

above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5c. this latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5c. ?we?re closer to the margin than we think,? said adrian raftery, a university of washington academic who led the research, published in nature climate change. ?if we want to avoid 2c, we have very little time left. the public should be very concerned.? governments settled on the 2c threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. the study, by the university of north carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  according to the university of washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2c and 4.9c by 2100. this would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the un?s intergovernmental panel on climate change. it negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6c beyond the pre-industrial era. rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (gdp) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. after building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in china and india ? two newly voracious consumers of energy. however, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2c limit.  the world?s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-saharan africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. it has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2c warming. however, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. donald trump?s pledge to remove the us, the world?s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  ?even if the 2c target isn?t met, action is very important,? said raftery. ?the more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. ?we would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won?t avoid 2c, and so it?s too late to do anything. on the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.? raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could ?dramatically? change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. andrew dessler, a climate scientist at texas a&m university who was not involved in the study, said the research?s conclusions were ?reasonable?

she said at the time.in a statement to the guardian, tesla confirmed the company had fired vandermeyden, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee?s allegations with the help of a ?a neutral, third-party expert? and concluded her complaints were unmerited.?despite repeatedly receiving special treatment at the expense of others, ms vandermeyden nonetheless chose to pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing tesla and falsely attacking our company in the press,? a tesla spokesperson said. ?after we carefully considered the facts on multiple occasions and were absolutely convinced that ms vandermeyden?s claims were illegitimate, we had no choice but to end her employment at tesla.??this was absolutely shocking for aj. she is devastated,? therese lawless, vandermeyden?s attorney, said by phone. ?she brought the lawsuit in an attempt to make the workplace at tesla more equitable and fair and to have tesla comply with the law.?asked about tesla?s justification for the firing, lawless said: ?they?ve just proven our case. it?s clear retaliation.? she added: ?somebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired.? vandermeyden?s firing is likely to reignite debate over employment standards in silicon valley, where startups and major tech corporations are grappling with complaints of systemic wage disparities, gender discrimination and sexual misconduct.an account of alleged sexism at uber went viral earlier this year, fueling debate about harassment in the industry, while a recent federal lawsuit against google has placed a spotlight on concerns about tech firms underpaying women.  lawless, who represented the former reddit ceo ellen pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit, against the venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield & byers, said she intended to file a formal retaliation complaint on behalf of vandermeyden. ?it is illegal in the state of california for an employer to retaliate against an employee who asserts her rights, including her rights to receive equal pay as her male colleagues.?vandermeyden, who started working at tesla in 2013, claims in her lawsuit that she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over as a manufacturing engineer in the general assembly department.her complaint further alleged that she raised issues about flaws in the quality testing of cars that her supervisors and male engineers had missed. although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions over her, she alleged. the complaint said that she and other female engineers were denied promotions despite the fact that they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men.vandermeyden also alleged that she experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?.further, the lawsuit accused tesla of retaliating against her for speaking up. management allegedly told her that in order to advance her position, she would need to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was not expected of male engineers and was unattainable. although she had positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department, according to the lawsuit, which also said that tesla retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower?. tesla has continued to strongly reject vandermeyden?s claims. a spokesperson said the company had ?conducted a thorough internal investigation? and ?extensively re-reviewed all the facts?, repeatedly concluding that her allegations were false. tesla added that vandermeyden had been granted numerous positions ?over other more qualified candidates? and was ?given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications?.?the termination was based on ms vandermeyden behaving in what the evidence indicates is a fundamentally false and misleading manner, not as a result of retaliation for the lawsuit,? the spokesperson added. ?it is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner and therefore continued employment is also impossible.?the vandermeyden case is one of several labor issues that have dogged tesla, which is facing growing scrutiny over its practices in california. earlier this month, the guardian published an investigation into working conditions at tesla?s ?factory of the future? in fremont, california, where several factory workers complained about their treatment at the plant.incident reports revealed that ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, seizures, dizziness, abnormal breathing and chest pains. a recent report from a worker safety organization found that tesla workers were injured at a rate 31% higher than the industry average in 2015.the company has said it has significantly improved safety standards in recent months at the factory, and musk told the guardian he cared deeply about the health and wellbeing of his employees. vandermeyden, in her interview with the guardian in february, emphasized that she believed tesla was a ?revolutionary and innovative company? and said she took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the model s car.?until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she added. ?i?m an advocate of tesla. i really do believe they are doing great things. that said, i can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.?at the time, vandermeyden said she was hopeful her lawsuit and public comments would not end her career at the company. but she expressed some concern that her decision to speak out could result in retaliation. ?half the time when i walk into work,?

in the most painful times ? i?ve been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court,? she wrote.williams has repeatedly been the target of sexist and racist remarks by men in tennis. in 2016 the chief executive of the indian wells tennis tournament, raymond moore, said women?s tennis was riding on the coat-tails of the men?s tour and that female players should ?thank god? for roger federer and rafael nadal. in april the romanian team captain, ilie nastase, made an apparently racist comment about williams?s unborn baby and was heard calling her and johanna konta ?fucking bitches?. most recently, former champion john mcenroe said williams would ?be, like, 700 in the world? if she played on the men?s tour. ?luckily i am blessed with an inner drive and a support system of family and friends that encourage me to move forward. but these injustices still hurt,? williams wrote.july 31 is black women's equal pay day. black women are the cornerstone of our communities, they are phenomenal, and they deserve equal pay. pic.twitter.com/xohyidbypcnoting that she is ?in the rare position to be financially successful beyond my imagination?, williams said that, if she had not been lucky enough to pick up a tennis racquet and break through, she would be like the other 24 million black women facing wage disparities in the us.?the cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the record for grand slam titles,? she wrote. ?for every black woman that rises through the ranks to a position of power, there are too many others who are still struggling.?she said that changing the status quo would take courage to push the issue into the spotlight and force employers to compensate female employees equally: ?we deserve equal pay for our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our nieces, friends, and colleagues ? but mostly for ourselves.?black women: be fearless. speak out for equal pay. every time you do, you?re making it a little easier for a woman behind you. let?s get back those 37 cents.?black women?s equal pay day, on 31 july, marked how long into 2017 an african american woman would have to work to be paid the same wages as her white male counterpart last year. ?despite the large gender disadvantage faced by all women, black women were near parity with white women in 1979,? the economic policy institute said. ?however in 2016, white women?s wages grew to 76% of white men?s, compared to 67% for black women relative to white men ? a racial difference of nine percentage points. the trend is going the wrong way ? progress is slowing for black women.?in the uk, research by the fawcett society in march revealed a similar story, that many minority ethnic women were ?left behind? by progress on the pay gap. black african women in the uk have seen virtually no progress since the 1990s in closing the gender pay gap with white british men, with a full-time pay gap of 21.4% in the 1990s and 19.6% today. ?black african women have been largely left behind, and in terms of closing the pay gap, pakistani and bangladeshi women are today only where white british women were in the 1990s,? sam smethers, the charity?s chief executive, said.the low number of staff from ethnic minorities on the bbc?s list of its best-paid talent has also provoked an angry response inside the corporation, after no black or ethnic minority staff featured among those earning the top 24 salaries. williams has been a consistent advocate of equal pay. earlier this month, when asked about what she would want for her child, she said: ?if my daughter were to play in a sport and she was able to have equal prize money, or equal pay, or equal rights, i feel like that would be a success. and if not, i would really want her to speak up for it. any daughter of mine will have a voice.?she also praised andy murray after he corrected a journalist who said sam querrey was ?the first us player to reach a major semi-final since 2009?. williams has joined the board of silicon valley firm surveymonkey to help tech companies diversify their workforces.",NEUTRAL,0.683558464050293

dominated by discussion of the adoption of russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.that statement was presented to the new york times on 8 july, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. but within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.on 9 july, the times revealed that trump jr had been lured into talking to veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, hillary clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?i love it?.the trump tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between trump associates and russia in the kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the republican nominee. the special counsel leading the investigation, robert mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the white house to preserve all documents relating to it.until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 june encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. but the new report that trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.it comes as mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired james comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the fbi to back off investigating former national security adviser michael flynn?s contacts with russian officials.a lawyer for the president issued the washington post with a curt statement: ?apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? jay sekulow said.the new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, anthony scaramucci, was dismissed from the white house after barely 11 days. the blunt removal was made on the first day of the new white house chief of staff, john kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the west wing has been sorely lacking.the day began shortly before 5.30am with trump tweeting ?no wh chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?a great day at the white house?. but as the washington post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the trump tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.according to the post, senior white house officials together with the circle around kushner and his wife, ivanka trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the trump tower meeting publicly.kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency?

today?s report has been criticised by some advocates for implying that universities only have an obligation to deal with incidents that happen in a university setting ? either on campus or at a university event. but the co-women?s officer at the university of sydney, imogen grant, told guardian australia today that assaults that occur outside of university grounds can still be reported to universities because they involve student perpetrators.she says we should keep in mind that student offenders can be disciplined by their university: most incidents of assault occur around the broader university community, in share houses and at social events.but the perpetrators are still fellow students. and if the perpetrator is a fellow student, you can report that to the university and you can expect disciplinary action as well.it?s also an issue raised by end rape on campus ambassador nina funnell, who said in today?s media conference that the report?s 10-point plan had no recommendations for improving disciplinary proceedings against offenders. in response, the chair of universities australia, prof margaret gardner, said she had ?begun a conversation? with universities about new misconduct proceedings. here?s a submission from the report itself that claims this issue has been overlooked:a woman who was sexually assaulted on numerous occasions by her intimate partner, a fellow university student, was told the university had ?no power to do anything, because none of it occurred on-campus?.she felt that the university should have taken action, because she was aware of the perpetrator sexually assaulting at least two other women at her university. updated

calla wahlquistat some point in the pub crawl, usually on the walk between pubs two and three, one of the guys at the front of the group would tip their head back and start singing: ?i wish all the women.?it?s a classic rhyming song, where the lead singer makes observations like, ?i wish all the women/were waves in the ocean/and if i was a surfer/i?d ride them with my motion,? and everybody else sings it back. by the train ride home even the most devoted singers would have run out of verses and switched to ?beastiality is best?. the hook is everybody chanting: ?beastiality is best, boys, beastiality is best. fuck a wallaby!?my two years living at a residential college at an australian university were some 10 years ago now, so i can only remember what we were supposed to do to an owl.details about the culture of sexual harassment and prevalence sexual assault at residential colleges contained in the ahrc report were appalling, but they did not surprise me. that?s just o-week. we had a golden bed springs award. i liked living at college. i was new to the city and did not know anyone and at college i had ready-made friends, some of whom remain close friends now. it?s only later that you think about what happened and realise it?s not normal. the eagle rock thing? we did that. there was a weekly newsletter about who had slept with who. everyone told rape jokes. we drank so much we couldn?t move. people who did not join in were ostracised. i remember one occasion where a woman from another hall said she had been raped from a male from our hall. the universal judgment was that she was a slut, she was just making it up. women did that all the time, didn?t they?updated

as mentioned earlier today, only 9% of students who had been sexually assaulted on their campus reported the attack to their university. here are some examples, in survivors? own words, of why they decided not to pursue the perpetrators of their assault or harassment. multiple submissions said they were deterred by their university?s failure to provide anonymous reporting:our cohort for our course is incredibly small. i felt too scared to report these incidents. i couldn?t have action taken against him because everyone would find out.another student had their identity disclosed to their rapist?s friends: the university broke confidentiality by informing organisers of the camp (i.e: the rapist?s friends) what i?d done. people spread lies about me and i was ostracised from the club.another said the university forced them into a process of face-to-face ?mediation? with their harasser:when i complained to the head of school i had a ?mediation? session with the professor who was harassing me ... he stormed out and slammed the door. he wasn?t told to change his behaviour, the ?mediation session? was all that was done.for many respondents there was always an underlying social pressure not to report, stemming from a fear of being ridiculed, ostracised or shamed for not doing enough. said one: it was my word against his. he?s known as being a really nice friendly guy so i didn?t think a lot of people would believe me or care.updated

residential colleges at australian universities are full of students from regional and remote areas, as well as international students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time. they?re usually co-ed.they?re also one of the highest risk places on campus for sexual assault and sexual harassment, according to the ahrc survey. twelve per cent of women and 3% of men who were sexually assaulted at a university in 2015 and 2016 said it had occurred at a residential college.the report found that hazing practices at colleges often involved excessive alcohol consumption and humiliating or degrading acts, ?and, in many cases, sexual harassment and sexual assault?.according to one submission:the aim is to get the freshers as drunk as possible. maybe a secondary aim is to make them look as ridiculous and embarrassing as possible, giving them costumes, props, and even sometimes smearing food all over them.said another:you had to participate, there was nothing you could do about it. the administration knew about this and they condoned this. the students had no power whatsoever, you couldn?t say anything. hazing practices described in the report included getting female students to ?run the gauntlet?, which meant running down a hallway where male students stood in every doorway with the nozzle of a cask of wine sticking out their fly. female students were required to kneel before each male resident and ?drink from his sack?.another college had a ritual where all first-year female students had to remove their top when a certain song was played. they would be surrounded by male students and unable to leave the dance floor with their top still on. other submissions described year-round traditions that focused on residents? sexual exploits.conquests of guys getting girls from other colleges were broadcasted weekly in this gossip session the whole college had, where you would submit your experiences to an executive, and on weeknights we would gather and hear about everyone?s conquests that week ... women were described as objects or trophies. the report also found that power relationships between resident advisers ? usually senior students ? and first-year students, as well as the close proximity created by living in residential colleges and the easy access to both alcohol and bedrooms, were contributing factors in the high rates of sexual assault. updated

","archaeologists have unearthed a large, centuries-old statue that is believed to have once stood guard over an ancient hospital at cambodia?s famed angkor temple complex.the nearly two metre tall carving, which is thought to be from the late 12th to the early 13th century, was discovered during a dig on saturday, said long kosal, a spokesman for apsara authority ? the state agency charged with managing the complex. the angkor archeological park, a world heritage site, contains the remains of the different capitals of the khmer empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is cambodia?s most popular tourist destination.at the height of its power the city and its hundreds of temples boasted more than a million inhabitants, making it one of the world?s most populous pre-industrial centres. huge swathes of the park have been excavated over the decades, creating a walkable archaeological wonder that attracts more than two million visitors a year. but the complex remains a treasure trove for yet to be discovered finds. cambodian archaeologists and experts from singapore?s institute of southeast asian studies found the statue buried 40 centimeters under the ground during an excavation of an angkor-era hospital built during the reign of king jayavarman vii.the apsara agency said the sandstone statue?s arms and legs had broken off but the carving on the body and head ?remain beautiful? despite the passage of time. they said the statue was likely to have been a symbolic guardian of the hospital. ",NEUTRAL,0.7223179340362549

""this is not a democracy but monarchy. and that is why pakistan has been left behind developed nations,"" khan who led a campaign to oust sharif said.","pakistan?s opposition leader, imran khan, has called for a future of ?real democracy? in the country, following the dismissal of nawaz sharif as prime minister over corruption charges.?we are thankful to the judiciary because with their judgment, they brought us a new hope,? khan told a gathering of thousands of supporters on sunday.the rally in islamabad was a triumphant celebration for the heartthrob-cricketer-turned-populist-politician, who, since last year, has led a campaign to oust sharif.friday?s ruling by pakistan?s highest court disrupted what had otherwise looked like a smooth path to next year?s election for sharif?s pml-n party.former oil minister shahid khaqan abbasi will most likely be approved as interim prime minister on tuesday, at a special session in the 342-member parliament, where the ruling pml-n party holds a strong majority.abbasi will hold the position for less than two months, until shahbaz sharif, younger brother of the ousted prime minister, is confirmed in parliament and can take over.thousands of supporters from khan?s pakistan tehreek-e insaf (pti) party congregated at islamabad?s parade ground on sunday for what had been termed a ?thanksgiving day?, the latest of khan?s signature rallies that have helped him drum up popular support.in front of flag-flying party cadres dressed in the red and green colours of pti, among towers of loudspeakers blasting music, khan likened pakistan?s rulers to ?mafia who safeguard personal interests at any cost?.?when we decided to move against nawaz in the panama case, everyone said it was a mistake because in the past, the powerful and mighty ones have been protected. but today i salute the court for giving hope to people for a new pakistan,? he said.since his political ascension in 2011, after 15 years in politics, khan has drawn support particularly from educated urbanites disillusioned with their political elites.?imran khan is fighting hard to let people know their political rights and their role in society. he has been a true example,? said syed ishfaq, face painted red and green, who had travelled to the capital from peshawar to participate in the celebration. last year, khan received a timely boost with the leak of the so-called panama papers, giving credence to his attacks against the political establishment, whom he has called ?the coalition of the corrupt?.after the leak, khan filed a constitutional petition to have the supreme court investigate the purchase of high-end london property through offshore companies in the name of sharif?s children, then minors.he organised street protests and demanded a ?lockdown? of islamabad until the country?s highest court ordered an inquiry into the pm.sharif, though, was not dismissed for actual corruption but for being deemed dishonest, according to the constitution?s article 62, over unreported income of about £2,000 from a dubai-based company owned by his son. sharif claims he never received the salary.however, he has not completely dodged a corruption verdict. in its ruling, the supreme court ordered a criminal investigation by an accountability court into the sharif family based on materials from the panama papers.the ouster of sharif has highlighted the decades-long fractious relationship between the now ex-prime minister and the military. there has been speculation that the court, with its verdict, simply did the military?s bidding, and that khan was a handy tool for the generals to cut down a prime minister with whom they have feuded for decades. khan?s supporters dismissed that idea.?if imran khan was really a puppet of the military, he would have become prime minister,? said ishfaq, referring to a claim by khan that former army chief pervez musharraf offered him the position.friday?s court decision sparked hope among demonstrators that the country?s corrupt leaders can be held accountable. however, the appointment of nawaz?s younger brother as new prime minister does little to accommodate equally forceful complaints that the sharif family holds a dynastic grip on power. ?this is is not a democracy but monarchy. it is not a meritocracy. and that is why pakistan has been left behind developed nations,? khan said from the stage.razmat khan, a supporter, agreed: ?shahbaz is the same as nawaz. they just want to keep power in the family.?supporters of sharif point out that during his tenure, the economy has grown and security has improved markedly. according to the government, growth reached 5.28% last year. the number of civilians killed in terrorist attacks has dropped from about 3,000 in 2013, when sharif came into office, to 612 in 2016.?i would give a bit of credit to nawaz sharif,? said ishfaq. ?but it is the law enforcement agencies that have brought peace.?yet, the improvements are tenuous. violence has recently resurged in a string of attacks by the pakistan taliban and islamic state, which constitutes a moderate but growing threat in pakistan. economic growth is held up by a swelling account deficit, and an overvalued currency is hampering exports. growth has also not seeped down to the lower classes who make up the majority of the nation of more than 200 million people.?thousands are jobless. there is no unemployment plan, and no economic policy except securing kickbacks,? said sheraz hassan, who drove his three children on a motorbike to the gathering.many of the celebrating khan supporters hoped that pakistan had turned a page. ?the prime minister of pakistan has been brought to justice,?

Swarnim Bagre,01 Aug 2017,trump's media chief sacked 10 days after appointment,www.theguardian.com,"white house communications director anthony scaramucci has been removed from his job within the first 10 days of his appointment. this comes after scaramucci, a harvard law graduate and former wall street financier, launched a foul-mouthed tirade against two of his senior colleagues at the white house last week. ""the president felt his comments were inappropriate,"" trump's spokeswoman said.","donald trump hailed ?a great day at the white house? following the removal of communications director anthony scaramucci after just 10 days in a move that has only increased the sense of chaos at the heart of the trump administration.his evening tweet came as scaramucci was forced out following a turbulent series of media appearances over the last week by the combative former wall street financier, capped by a foul-mouthed tirade to a new yorker journalist on thursday.his shock political demise was precipitated by the appointment of former us marine gen john kelly as donald trump?s new chief of staff less than six hours earlier.?anthony scaramucci will be leaving his role as white house communications director,? said press secretary sarah huckabee sanders in a statement on monday afternoon. ?mr scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff john kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. we wish him all the best.?a great day at the white house!the decision to remove scaramucci, nicknamed ?the mooch?, came at kelly?s request, the new york times reported. his removal may take some pressure off steve bannon, the longtime trump aide whose position has been under threat in recent weeks. scaramucci made bannon a target in his rant to the new yorker and, in response, was the subject of repeatedly negative articles on breitbart, the publication bannon once ran.scaramucci was hired on 21 july, months after the departure of michael dubke, who had struggled to craft a coherent communications strategy as the administration spun from one controversy to the next. sean spicer reportedly opposed the hiring of scaramucci and resigned as white house press secretary the same day.spicer was spotted by reporters in the west wing apparently helping to shape the statement announcing scaramucci?s removal from office.scaramucci?s appointment was also reportedly opposed by chief of staff reince priebus, who immediately came under fire from the new communications chief for alleged leaks, and was forced out on friday and replaced by kelly. as his first act, kelly in turn seems to have forced out scaramucci.asked if scaramucci had any role now in the white house, the press secretary, sarah huckabee sanders, told a media briefing: ?he does not have a role at this time.?scaramucci, loyal and telegenic, was named white house communication director, a move that immediately prompted the resignation of press secretary sean spicer.scaramucci spent his first saturday on the job cleaning up his twitter feed to remove historic tweets critical of the president and his agenda.'the mooch', as he likes to be known, appeared on the sunday morning politics tv shows. he promised to root out ?leakers? and said any he found would be fired.scaramucci?s estranged wife, deidre ball, gave birth to their second child in new york. scaramucci traveled on air force one with the president to the boy scouts annual jamboree.thumbs up and smiles aboard air force one on the way to ohio.scaramucci dined at the white house with the president, the first lady, fox news host sean hannity and former fox news executive bill shine. after dinner, he placed a fateful call to new yorker writer, ryan lizza...... the new yorker published that conversation.the new york post reported that scaramucci?s infatuation with trump was a catalyst for his wife?s decision to file for divorce while nine months pregnant. meanwhile trump announces on twitter that reince priebus is out as chief of staff.scaramucci watched as john kelly was sworn in as the president?s new chief of staff. hours later, the white house announced that scaramucci was out as white house communications director, reportedly at the urging of kelly.turning to scaramucci?s new yorker interview, she said: ?the president felt his comments were inappropriate.?she would not say whether scaramucci was fired or had resigned, but added that he had felt ?he did not want to burden gen kelly with that line of succession?.kelly had been given full authority by the president over the white house staff and ?all staff will report to him?, she said.a long island native with an affinity for the spotlight, scaramucci had long drawn comparisons to trump himself. both men have deep ties to new york, and trump was said to admire scaramucci?s unflinching loyalty.a graduate of harvard law school and a former goldman sachs banker, scaramucci founded the global hedge fund skybridge capital in 2005, but sold it in 2017 in preparation for a role in the trump administration. he founded the salt conference, named after his company, which attracts big name speakers from washington, hollywood and wall street.though scaramucci became a critical fundraiser for the trump campaign, it was not his first choice. before the presidential campaign of 2012, scaramucci expressed early support for hillary clinton. ?i hope she runs [in 2016], she is incredibly competent,? he apparently wrote in a deleted tweet from april 2012, according to screenshots published by the daily beast. he also called her ?the real deal.?but when the campaign actually arrived, he first donated to wisconsin governor scott walker?s campaign until it collapsed, and then he joined jeb bush.before he joined the trump campaign, scaramucci called trump ?anti-american? and ?another hack politician?.?i?ll tell you who he?s gonna be president of, you can tell donald i said this: the queens county bullies association,? scaramucci said during a segment on fox business in august 2015. ?you are an inherited-money dude from queens county. bring it.?after being hired by trump, he deleted a number of his old tweets that contradicted the president?s policy positions.his most controversial moment during his short tenure as communications chief was undoubtedly his remarks to a new yorker interviewer that the then-chief of staff, reince priebus, was ?a fucking paranoid schizophrenic? who would be asked to resign (he later was), and that scaramucci was not like steve bannon, the chief strategist, because ?i?m not trying to suck my own cock?.the washington post reported that kelly was ?dismayed? by the interview and found it ?abhorrent and embarrassing for the president?.named director of communications after having been denied a white house role earlier, the new york financier and republican fundraiser promptly threatened to fire everyone in his team over leaks. he also staged a combative and contradictory briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about suspiciously liberal pronouncements in his past and support for trump?s republican enemies; deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, reince priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of americans to lincoln?s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, priebus and steve bannon down the phone to a new yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son; saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.trump?s first national security adviser ? one of four generals the president has employed ? resigned after it was revealed he misled vice-president mike pence over his contacts with russians during the election campaign. it was later reported that yates had warned the white house flynn was vulnerable to russian blackmail.the most shocking firing of them all. trump sacked his fbi director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between trump aides and russia gathered pace. lest anyone retain any doubt about why trump pressed the big red button, he told nbc in a primetime interview the firing was tied to ?this russia thing?. the reverberations will be felt for some time yet.the long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president handed in his resignationin response to scaramucci?s appointment. a republican insider and priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after an infamous debut in which he angrily insisted trump?s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. achieving by way of melissa mccarthy?s lethal saturday night live impression a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the white house were long rumoured to be numbered. his departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.the former republican national committee chair stayed loyal ? at least in public ? to trump through friday, when he was told his time was up. he stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with cnn and, of course, fox news. but it seemed priebus?s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of scaramucci, which enraged the mooch, or by his closeness to the house speaker, paul ryan, than by his private advice to trump to quit the presidential race after 8 october, when the infamous access hollywood ?gropegate? tape was published. the washington post reported that priebus was thus never considered a member of the ?oct 8th coalition?, a name for the inner cabal of trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss?s reputation has sunk.chinese conglomerate hna group is currently in negotiations to buy skybridge capital. scaramucci announced the sale at the world economic forum in davos in january, which was meant to free him of potential conflicts of interest before an official appointment.but that sale ? believed to be worth $250m ? is being held back pending a government review, reportedly by the committee on foreign investment in the united states, the agency charged with evaluating the impact on america?s national security of the sales of us businesses.scaramucci?s wife deirdre filed for divorce recently while nine months pregnant with their second child. scaramucci missed the birth last monday because he was traveling with trump on air force one.the firing met with some swift praise on capitol hill. carlos curbelo, a moderate republican from florida who did not support trump in 2016, tweeted: ?general kelly is 1 for 1. let?s keep it going,? tweeted curbelo.trump tweeted this morning: ?highest stock market ever, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, sc: no wh chaos!?additional reporting by dominic rushe in new york",SUBJECTIVE,0.9617109298706055
